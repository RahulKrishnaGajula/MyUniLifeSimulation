13,"- No place to study. - Cafeteria has less than 100 seats which means you can never get a seat during launch. - not even 1 year in my lecture hall is already breaking apart - constantly having issues with my student id not working. - yeah sure the greenery looks nice. but the campus is simply to small and lacks the facilities that a university should have, I know several it colleges and some community colleges that have better facilities than this campus.

59,"Absolute best university I originally went to UCD but dropped out after a year and went to DCU, when comparing the two I found DCU had more to offer both academically and socially. It has a sort of family atmosphere where everyone plays an important role. Classes are smaller and more personal so lecturers go to a special effort to teach everyone at all levels, individually. The facilities for students are exemplary with only a short walk between all. In my previous college experience I had a long walking trip between facilities like gym and library, even basic lecture halls. Overall I’d really recommend DCU if you’re looking for a thriving college life and do well academically. 10/10",1.0

I have received no emails from the college or any lecturer, or even the college itself. i had to call registration services for them to tell me that I can;t register because my accounts have been disabled.

93,"My experience with Trinity College totally falls under the overall discomfort related to the pandemic. Due to COVID, I've never been able to visit neither the campus nor the city of Dublin, so I invite you to consider my words accordingly. I did not appreciate how the university handled the whole thing. I paid a lot of money to take part to an MPhil I am not very happy to have attended. The professors were very good, but the institution made me feel alone, abandoned. For someone who could not go outside due to the restrictions, the workload revealed to be quite heavy: I went burnout almost twice and event went to the hospital. Moreover, the digital library services were insufficient, so I had to find ""colorful"" ways to retrieve material to write my dissertation. No, we did not have a discount. Last but not least, my degree was not specialising at all, and I spent eight months sending hundreds of curricula.
Happy to have stayed at home, the student housing cost was ridiculous anyways.",0.0
94,"I feel like I graduated despite how the programme was structured, not by benefiting from the academic excellence Trinity likes to brag about. Professors seemed swamed by their work as researchers - which advances their careers more than teaching - and the educational experience suffers greatly under this. Seminars were often little more than research papers verbally summarised by a professor with lack of interest in teaching being evident. Feedback on papers in the Master program that I did was often just a number slapped on a submission months after the deadline. When I ocasionally asked for clarification I received either snappy or no responses at all. Other annoyances are a lack of seating spaces to eat, effectively forcing you to spend money in the canteen if you want to stay warm and dry. As a graduate I thus reach this conclusion: If you want a good name on your CV, study at Trinity. If you want an engaging educational experience, consider other options.",0.0
95,Really enjoying it so far. Only thing that is frustrating is that it takes a while to hear back.,1.0
96,"Trinity was the perfect choice for me, as the master's program I completed was interdisciplinary, interesting, and what I wanted to study. The faculty were very helpful and knowledgeable",1.0
97,TCD is an awesome university but sometimes you can feel a bit forgotten about by the administration.,1.0
98,"Trinity is generally a good university, with a lot of life happening. However, you can tell it is slowly getting interested only with getting more and more money, milking students more each year. The TCDSU is not really 100% towards defending us, since it is more a façade for the administration to appease students and pretend they care. I have encountered a lot of issues with connecting with the WIFI. Also they do not seem to care about students’ mental health since the waiting time is 3 months for a meeting and they have not increased the budget allocated to it, despite their claims.",1.0

101,The No.1 university in Ireland,1.0
102,Brilliant student life and lovely campus!,1.0
103,The one problem would be the lack of seating for people wanting to eat food. There’s no area where people can bring their own food to eat. You’re kicked out of the Buttery if you eat anything other than what they sell you. How is this fair? Not everyone can afford to pay for lunch everyday and that doesn’t mean they should be told to sit outside and eat it.,1.0

105,"Trinity is fantastic, there’s a space for everyone to find their niche and I feel more at home here than I have anywhere in my whole life",1.0
106,"I was deeply deeply unhappy the whole time I studied here. What is crazy to me is how good everything outside uni was going while studying there was absolutely miserable. Trinity was happy to hold me up as an example from a ‘disadvantaged area’ at an event in first year, but the support pretty much stopped there. The first two years were exhausting trying to pander to Trinity students who tend to be pretty well off and not very inclusive, and I found it very hard to make genuine friends. There was no full time professors in my department, just lecturers who come in for an hour or two a day other than that the building is empty. In first year I had ten hours a week, and the hours went down ever year so that in my final year I had just 5 hours a week plus a 10 minute zoom slot to talk about my portfolio. You might think I’m being pessimistic or dramatic, but I would genuinely implore you to explore other options and get opinions from other people before you choose Trinity.",0.0
107,"I love Trinity campus, so many different places to sit down and relax after classes",1.0
108,"The actual learning is really good and the social aspect is really good, but the current student union body is terrible i don’t understand how they were elected. The careers guidance, i don’t know if it’s just for my field, but it’s basically non existent, i’m finishing third year and have practically no idea of what my options are for when I finish. That’s something they could use a little more work with. I’m in stem, and all the lab facilities are really good. However, the administration in Trinity is literally so bad, a lot of important information my course found out was through people in the year ahead or from people in other courses. It needs a lot of improvement.",1.0

Student union is the same, rich southside socialites with too much time on their hands.

139,"Experience of a science & health science faculty student.
Campus/Facilities 2/5, lack of student space in the science side of campus for eating, studying, printing facilities were often out of order, computer room spaces were insufficient.
Clubs and societies 3/5, there was a huge array of clubs and societies that would put on plenty of events all year.
Students Union 3/5, often disengaged from SU likely due to distance, SU and faculty miscommunications leading to disruption of student services occurring during my time.
Careers service 3/5, the careers service is excellent, the guidance councilors especially so, however, their services could be better funded to allow students more time with councilors/other services.
Internet/Wifi 4/5, Wifi's fine .

143,The societies are the best things about Trinity College Dublin. Each society has great facilities and the work ethic of the committee are incredible. On the campus I feel the college needs more areas for sitting down and reading that is not the library. There is a lack of “hang out” places for people who are not in a society and the quality of the ones that are already there is lacking. The gym could be bigger and the WiFi never worked for me once in my four years there. I would of liked more help in the career service and I did not get much. Trinity is an amazing place however in terms of it’s historical campus ground and the atmosphere within the walls of the college is always so vibrant and exciting. I love this university a lot.,1.0

147,"Extremely slow and incompetent administration, no one replies to emails and no one answers the phone. I don't recommend this college. Teaching is also poor compared to American Universities.",0.0
148,"As an international student from the U.S., Trinity was a great university, full of opportunities to meet new people and engage with the Dublin community. The academic atmosphere took a bit of time to understand as the grading system differs from the US, but the classes were of excellent quality, and the use of tutorials and seminars allowed us to explore our subjects in greater depth.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest drawbacks of TCD is its partial disregard for international students in particular. The cost (though less than many U.S. institutions) is roughly x4 the Irish national rate. Paired with the unnecessarily difficult immigration permission process each year and poor communication within the academic registry, there is a significant burden of stress placed on (non-EU) international students.

Nevertheless, my time at Trinity has been worth the chaos, and I am grateful for the experience that fostered many of my most cherished memories and closest friendships.",1.0

154,Trinity College exudes magnificence. The rich history of the college makes you a success as soon as you begin your studies here. Millions of activities go on in various locations in college each day. Skill enhancement is amazing coupled with the great staff. Its worth your time and money.,1.0
155,"A big concept for Irish institutions is that there are little to no gen-eds unless you take a Broad Curriculum module. This leads to a great, expert-level understanding of your major, but if you want more of a general knowledge degree, Trinity might not be the best for you. Also, as Trinity is the largest, most well-known university in Ireland, they are very conscious of their image. As a result, decisions that the more modern students would disagree with are chosen by the administration in order to appear PC. WARNING: Trinity is not wheel-chair friendly AT ALL unless you have someone there to help you - especially if you're near the STEM (back) side of campus.

On the student life side, TCD has a lot of clubs and societies for students to choose from, from our two debating societies (the Hist and the Phil) to QSoc -
our LGBTQIA+ society to Food and Drink Society to Judo - there's a society or club for anyone and everyone in Trinity (and if there isn't, you can always make one!)",1.0

158,"The off-campus dining options are okay because Trinity is in the heart of Dublin. However, being a big city, everything is very expensive.",1.0
159,"If you want the traditional American college experience relating to Athletics, you should probably consider a traditional American college. There are certainly sports available at Trinity if you want to pursue them but they're not central to the culture of the school nor do you even really notice them on a daily basis. The athletics facilities are quite new and seem (based upon my *very* limited experience with them) modern, clean, etc... and easy to use. They're also relatively inexpensive compared to a monthly gym membership or even other Dublin colleges like UCD. Returning to sports though, if you want to participate in them, you do so through clubs and societies.

161,"Hi
My name is Rashi. I completed my master’s from ucd in the year 2015 and i cherish every single learning from that place.
I was always into small things like save water, plant more trees, reduce energy consumption, no to plastic, recycling paper and many more. UCD’s intercultural environment and the new approaches i noticed was the most interesting at first. Later my master gave me a huge opportunity to learn the news ways and technology to save earth Or basically to save us.
The reduction for plastic can be done at verious level of its life. Therefore LCA (life cycle assessment ) modules were of great knowledge.
The reduction of energy consumption and conservation for the animal and plant farming were also very important and new to me.
Teachers and mentors were also excellent help. ",1.0

183,"I studied in this university for 5 years from 2014 - 2019, and what an excellent education I received here. I graduated with a 1:1 Bachelors of Agricultural science degree (Specialising in Horticulture and Landscape mgt) OK WELL... Educational facilities, e.g laboratories, classrooms, computer rooms, tutorials, studios, Library, ag testing sites....are next level, 1st class ++++ Educational staff: A++ were really great, very helpful, understanding, good presenters, extremely knowledgeable, links with Industry etc... Course content: very thorough, applicable to industry A+ Campus: B-..........A lot of people complain about the campus, but tbh its very green, well maintained, two lakes, open air, safe, bright. My only gripe would be there are not enough places to hang out/congregate!! its almost too big, in a weird way XD Club & Societies- A+++ Absolutely incredible. i got really involved with the mountaineering club, Horticulture society and rowing team too :) so much to offer, they add so much value, easy way to meet new people!!! amazing fun. Social life: GRADE C......I found it really difficult to meet new friends here (and I know many many others that did)...i really had a hard time integrating and i'm not a shy, or introverted person at all. Although I met many people I only made like 2 real friends in 4 years which is kinda dissapointing. I was so desperate to fit in, but I never could, I still dunno why to this day. Many of my friends went to TCD, DCU and trinity made so many new friends and life long friends...but there is something about UCD that makes it hard to make real friends. In the first 3 months, lots of people form a clique that they stick with for the next 4 years and if you aren't in a clique by then, well then good luck. I knew a lot of lonely people here, some even dropped out because of it. I mean I was very lonely for periods in UCD. The bar at UCD, isn't much craic at all, got a weird layout and pretty small for the size of UCD. it was the last day on campus, and they were playing live music and everyone was standing there like fools. So it ended being just me and two punk guys that danced XD beer is expensive too, like regular prices. (DONT GET ME WRONG, You will be friendly and have 'uni friends' yes, but long term mates, outside of campus, im not sure) This really is my only gripe, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 4!!! BUT STILL, VERY GRATFEFUL FOR MY EDUCATION HERE, and it was a fantastic experience all the same. I leave you with a great photo from HORTICULTURE SOCIETY (Which I managed for 2 years) and mountaineering party and Rosemount, !

At the time, Ireland was in the middle of a recession, and we were totally unprepared for what was to come with totally impractical courses, such as sub editing with a ruler and a calculator. There were also enforced courses on philosophy which were utterly useless in the newsroom. They owed more to the professor's academic interest. There were some glimmers of light in a dark year, I found the late Eddie Holt brilliant. I also must speak very highly of the Intra office, who were marvellous which gives two stars. The campus is ugly and small in grey North Dublin. I feel there are infinitely better MA Journalism options elsewhere, however things may have changed. I am delighted to never have to return.",0.0
218,"I don't wanna be biased in my verdict, but providing review on the university system could be subjective not necessary following on standardised rules. I'd say my experience with DCU was not the best. The teachers and assistant teachers are complicating the things in old fashion they thought it is academic standard. Some of them really didn't know how to discuss and elaborate simple basic theories instead they preferred to post YouTube or other links to let the students watch it. Be careful with the description of the modules because it is not extensively providing details in terms of prerequisites and level of studying of the students. If you are coming from non English speaking country as a first language then perhaps the grades of your bachelor or master would be downgraded due to grammar mistakes even if your English is superb and passed ILETS with highest grades. Some teachers are using this way to reduce your overall grades. conversely, I have seen a lot of mistakes and proof -reading from many teachers as well. I have experienced many mistakes in my grades from DCU however I preferred first to point it out to my coordinator rather than suing them. During academic sessions, I have spotted many mistakes from the the module' s coordinator, however I was not appreciative instead the professor didn't solve any problems in the tutorial letting the students to solve everything without even final answers because there was non trust to share the answers which somehow could expose the weakness of the material. In addition to the mistakes of the principles used by the professor for the record all of the problems were taken from internet. I was disappointed I realized it would be much better for me to learn myself on my own pace. Last thing, maybe you will be lucky with other schools in DCU if they are not reluctant to better ways of education system, the management and teachers need to engage with other system globally to see the difference and find widen scope to develop themselves.
