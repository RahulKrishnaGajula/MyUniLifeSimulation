61,Student,"Absolute best university I originally went to UCD but dropped out after a year and went to DCU, when comparing the two I found DCU had more to offer both academically and socially. It has a sort of family atmosphere where everyone plays an important role. Classes are smaller and more personal so lecturers go to a special effort to teach everyone at all levels, individually. The facilities for students are exemplary with only a short walk between all. In my previous college experience I had a long walking trip between facilities like gym and library, even basic lecture halls.

95,Student,"My experience with Trinity College totally falls under the overall discomfort related to the pandemic. Due to COVID, I've never been able to visit neither the campus nor the city of Dublin, so I invite you to consider my words accordingly. I did not appreciate how the university handled the whole thing. I paid a lot of money to take part to an MPhil I am not very happy to have attended. The professors were very good, but the institution made me feel alone, abandoned. For someone who could not go outside due to the restrictions, the workload revealed to be quite heavy: I went burnout almost twice and event went to the hospital. Moreover, the digital library services were insufficient, so I had to find ""colorful"" ways to retrieve material to write my dissertation. No, we did not have a discount. Last but not least, my degree was not specialising at all, and I spent eight months sending hundreds of curricula.
Happy to have stayed at home, the student housing cost was ridiculous anyways.",2.2,5,2014,https://www.studentcrowd.com/university-l1054971-s1054985-trinity-college-dublin-dublin,www.studentcrowd.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,0
96,Student,"I feel like I graduated despite how the programme was structured, not by benefiting from the academic excellence Trinity likes to brag about. Professors seemed swamed by their work as researchers - which advances their careers more than teaching - and the educational experience suffers greatly under this. Seminars were often little more than research papers verbally summarised by a professor with lack of interest in teaching being evident. Feedback on papers in the Master program that I did was often just a number slapped on a submission months after the deadline. When I ocasionally asked for clarification I received either snappy or no responses at all. Other annoyances are a lack of seating spaces to eat, effectively forcing you to spend money in the canteen if you want to stay warm and dry. As a graduate I thus reach this conclusion: If you want a good name on your CV, study at Trinity. If you want an engaging educational experience, consider other options.",2.8,5,2014,https://www.studentcrowd.com/university-l1054971-s1054985-trinity-college-dublin-dublin,www.studentcrowd.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,0

The first two years were exhausting trying to pander to Trinity students who tend to be pretty well off and not very inclusive, and I found it very hard to make genuine friends. There was no full time professors in my department, just lecturers who come in for an hour or two a day other than that the building is empty. In first year I had ten hours a week, and the hours went down ever year so that in my final year I had just 5 hours a week plus a 10 minute zoom slot to talk about my portfolio.

Campus/Facilities 2/5, lack of student space in the science side of campus for eating, studying, printing facilities were often out of order, computer room spaces were insufficient.
Clubs and societies 3/5, there was a huge array of clubs and societies that would put on plenty of events all year.
Students Union 3/5, often disengaged from SU likely due to distance, SU and faculty miscommunications leading to disruption of student services occurring during my time.
Careers service 3/5, the careers service is excellent, the guidance councilors especially so, however, their services could be better funded to allow students more time with councilors/other services.

150,Student,"As an international student from the U.S., Trinity was a great university, full of opportunities to meet new people and engage with the Dublin community. The academic atmosphere took a bit of time to understand as the grading system differs from the US, but the classes were of excellent quality, and the use of tutorials and seminars allowed us to explore our subjects in greater depth.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest drawbacks of TCD is its partial disregard for international students in particular. The cost (though less than many U.S. institutions) is roughly x4 the Irish national rate. Paired with the unnecessarily difficult immigration permission process each year and poor communication within the academic registry, there is a significant burden of stress placed on (non-EU) international students.

Nevertheless, my time at Trinity has been worth the chaos, and I am grateful for the experience that fostered many of my most cherished memories and closest friendships.",4.0,5,2017,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

157,Student,"A big concept for Irish institutions is that there are little to no gen-eds unless you take a Broad Curriculum module. This leads to a great, expert-level understanding of your major, but if you want more of a general knowledge degree, Trinity might not be the best for you. Also, as Trinity is the largest, most well-known university in Ireland, they are very conscious of their image. As a result, decisions that the more modern students would disagree with are chosen by the administration in order to appear PC. WARNING: Trinity is not wheel-chair friendly AT ALL unless you have someone there to help you - especially if you're near the STEM (back) side of campus.

On the student life side, TCD has a lot of clubs and societies for students to choose from, from our two debating societies (the Hist and the Phil) to QSoc -
our LGBTQIA+ society to Food and Drink Society to Judo - there's a society or club for anyone and everyone in Trinity (and if there isn't, you can always make one!)",4.0,5,2019,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

There are certainly sports available at Trinity if you want to pursue them but they're not central to the culture of the school nor do you even really notice them on a daily basis. The athletics facilities are quite new and seem (based upon my *very* limited experience with them) modern, clean, etc... and easy to use. They're also relatively inexpensive compared to a monthly gym membership or even other Dublin colleges like UCD. Returning to sports though, if you want to participate in them, you do so through clubs and societies. Thus, you sign up for rugby club if you want to play rugby or the Hockey club if you want to play hockey. From what I know of these clubs, some of them are thinly veiled drinking societies especially in the lower quality teams whereas others are quite competitive.",3.0,5,2019,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

My name is Rashi. I completed my masterÆs from ucd in the year 2015 and i cherish every single learning from that place.
I was always into small things like save water, plant more trees, reduce energy consumption, no to plastic, recycling paper and many more. UCDÆs intercultural environment and the new approaches i noticed was the most interesting at first. Later my master gave me a huge opportunity to learn the news ways and technology to save earth Or basically to save us.
The reduction for plastic can be done at verious level of its life. Therefore LCA (life cycle assessment ) modules were of great knowledge.
The reduction of energy consumption and conservation for the animal and plant farming were also very important and new to me.

201,Kauri Maher,"I studied in this university for 5 years from 2014 - 2019, and what an excellent education I received here. I graduated with a 1:1 Bachelors of Agricultural science degree (Specialising in Horticulture and Landscape mgt) OK WELL... Educational facilities, e.g laboratories, classrooms, computer rooms, tutorials, studios, Library, ag testing sites....are next level, 1st class ++++ Educational staff: A++ were really great, very helpful, understanding, good presenters, extremely knowledgeable, links with Industry etc... Course content: very thorough, applicable to industry A+ Campus: B-..........A lot of people complain about the campus, but tbh its very green, well maintained, two lakes, open air, safe, bright. My only gripe would be there are not enough places to hang out/congregate!! its almost too big, in a weird way XD Club & Societies- A+++ Absolutely incredible. i got really involved with the mountaineering club, Horticulture society and rowing team too :) so much to offer, they add so much value, easy way to meet new people!!! amazing fun. Social life: GRADE C......I found it really difficult to meet new friends here (and I know many many others that did)...i really had a hard time integrating and i'm not a shy, or introverted person at all. Although I met many people I only made like 2 real friends in 4 years which is kinda dissapointing. I was so desperate to fit in, but I never could, I still dunno why to this day. Many of my friends went to TCD, DCU and trinity made so many new friends and life long friends...but there is something about UCD that makes it hard to make real friends. In the first 3 months, lots of people form a clique that they stick with for the next 4 years and if you aren't in a clique by then, well then good luck. I knew a lot of lonely people here, some even dropped out because of it. I mean I was very lonely for periods in UCD. The bar at UCD, isn't much craic at all, got a weird layout and pretty small for the size of UCD. it was the last day on campus, and they were playing live music and everyone was standing there like fools. So it ended being just me and two punk guys that danced XD beer is expensive too, like regular prices. (DONT GET ME WRONG, You will be friendly and have 'uni friends' yes, but long term mates, outside of campus, im not sure) This really is my only gripe, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 4!!! BUT STILL, VERY GRATFEFUL FOR MY EDUCATION HERE, and it was a fantastic experience all the same. I leave you with a great photo from HORTICULTURE SOCIETY (Which I managed for 2 years) and mountaineering party and Rosemount, !

It shows they drastically missed the part of forward thinking while designing such a great organisation. As I am talking about design, the design of auditorium is a disaster. I cannot comprehend how someone with a right mind, with right experience, with right education, with right interest may design, get approval, build such a mess!

At the time, Ireland was in the middle of a recession, and we were totally unprepared for what was to come with totally impractical courses, such as sub editing with a ruler and a calculator. There were also enforced courses on philosophy which were utterly useless in the newsroom. They owed more to the professor's academic interest. There were some glimmers of light in a dark year, I found the late Eddie Holt brilliant. I also must speak very highly of the Intra office, who were marvellous which gives two stars. The campus is ugly and small in grey North Dublin. I feel there are infinitely better MA Journalism options elsewhere, however things may have changed.

236,MeWithTheFuture,"I don't wanna be biased in my verdict, but providing review on the university system could be subjective not necessary following on standardised rules. I'd say my experience with DCU was not the best. The teachers and assistant teachers are complicating the things in old fashion they thought it is academic standard. Some of them really didn't know how to discuss and elaborate simple basic theories instead they preferred to post YouTube or other links to let the students watch it. Be careful with the description of the modules because it is not extensively providing details in terms of prerequisites and level of studying of the students. If you are coming from non English speaking country as a first language then perhaps the grades of your bachelor or master would be downgraded due to grammar mistakes even if your English is superb and passed ILETS with highest grades. Some teachers are using this way to reduce your overall grades. conversely, I have seen a lot of mistakes and proof -reading from many teachers as well. I have experienced many mistakes in my grades from DCU however I preferred first to point it out to my coordinator rather than suing them. During academic sessions, I have spotted many mistakes from the the module' s coordinator, however I was not appreciative instead the professor didn't solve any problems in the tutorial letting the students to solve everything without even final answers because there was non trust to share the answers which somehow could expose the weakness of the material. In addition to the mistakes of the principles used by the professor for the record all of the problems were taken from internet. I was disappointed I realized it would be much better for me to learn myself on my own pace. Last thing, maybe you will be lucky with other schools in DCU if they are not reluctant to better ways of education system, the management and teachers need to engage with other system globally to see the difference and find widen scope to develop themselves.

368,Cleiton Nunes,"DBS was the worst institution I've studied my whole life, even considering that I did a previous degree in a ""third-world country"". Having professional experience in the field I've chosen to study at DBS and also having a previous degree on the same area I can tell that main topics of important modules are not given to the students in my class. There are lecturers with an amazing professional CV or even great career achievements, but at the same time I've seen people learning or understanding nothing from them, even different groups would tell they couldn't follow the classes. One of those terrible lecturers once refused to give explanations or clarify the topics ""explained"". The college has no transparency with the students and all information given ate mostly not accurate or incomplete. I was January intake and my class just found out we were not having holidays 1 month before the end of our classes, at the same time that we were taken by surprise by the college saying we would have to pay earlier than expected. Every single staff give different informations, in a way that you talk personally, give a call, send an email and get 3 completely different answers in all your attempts.",1.0,5,2 weeks ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104826878534847681798/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpg6ef5OP7AhWBEGIAHZ9nChQQvfQBegQIARBs,www.google.com,Dublin Business School,"13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland",0
369,Sam Mathew,Not a bad college to be fairly honest but could do better with how they approach teaching. Lectures are seen in a boring light by the majority anyway so lecturers could bring a bit more enthusiasm and chip to the classroom and engage with the students more rather than just read off PowerPoint slides (we could do that at home if we wanted). Support provided by Admin staff is however stellar. Any requests and advice is provided promptly so kudos to that. Amenities are a plenty since the institution is located smack right in the heart of Dublin.,3.0,5,3 years ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104223190608949867784/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT--Of5OP7AhXXLFkFHZPzDmwQvfQBegUIARCHAQ,www.google.com,Dublin Business School,"13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland",1

My only bad experience I had there was they didn't really help you find internship during the third year. The issue is that college doesn't reach out to software companies to build relationships so these companies are willing to take on students for internships. It's up to you to find one. There was a class that was supposed to help us to find jobs but it was useless as the lecturer didn't care.

421,Conor Nolan,"Course studied: BA Business Blended study Currently in my second year of the three year degree Working full-time, I had completely written off any chance that I would study at third level. The month before I applied to Griffith I had watched my friends graduate from their respective studies and I really felt like Id missed out. When I read about blended learning on the Griffith website, I ended up feeling like I'd stumbled across this amazing secret. Before applying, I was worried that working full-time would make it impossible to study without becoming a hermit. The truth is, you can actually keep a great balance if you make a plan early and stick to it. The blended learning approach involves weekly video lectures and webinars with monthly workshops delivered on Saturdays. The other students in my course are great, everyone works together to help one another, in particular around exam time. You're surrounded by other students in your exact position and the support network of students and lecturers help you stay on top of things. It can be challenging at times when work and college, unbeknownst to one another, get busier simultaneously. If, like me you plan on studying while working full-time, I would definitely recommend you have the conversation with work early and keep them in the loop. Once you can communicate with your employer what's going on with college, it can be much easier to harmonize work and study. Blended learning at Griffith has enabled me to study at third level and progress in my career before I've even graduated. Its a great feeling when you can apply what you've studied in college, at work. Balancing work and college brings a structure to my life and helps keep me focused. Im halfway through my degree now and I'm really proud of how far I've come. My biggest regret was that I didnt start blended study sooner.",5.0,5,3 years ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116644202622208860213/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARBE,www.google.com,Griffith College,"S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland",1

436,Ahmed Kabir,"Munster Technological University (MTU) is a well ranked university in Cork, Ireland. Faculty of Engineering is very popular. MSc. in Data science under dept. of Mathematics is one the cheaper one year course . Plenty of Indian students studying data science and getting good jobs, once graduated. Professors are highly profiled and offering graduate studentship or PhD positions to talented student. Also, significant number of scholarships for native and foreign students which cover both the tuition fees and living expenses. All prospective student please keep in mind that don't through garbage email or CV to professors. Organized your CV and email like a professional and I bet you will get a positive feed back. MTU is also friendly for foreign students. There is a football ground and Gymnasium for sports and exercise. The bus no. 205 is going to city center from MTU. Free toilets are located in each floor in each building but only accessible for students and staffs. However, strangers might sneak in and can use the toilet too. Enough students accommodations to accommodate large number of students but expensive! Student can also rent and share house outside which is relatively cheaper.

I'm 2 years into my course and I would advise anyone thinking of going here to just go to UCC instead it can't possibly be any less organised there. To give a few examples of the sort of thing to expect from CIT there's been plenty of times we've been a few weeks into a project or assignment and then get told the lecturer has changed their mind on what they want done forcing us to redo it either partially or totally.

447,Connal Donohoe,"My experience here was very poor, I completed 2 years of the computing level 8 course and not only were my lecturers in 2nd year absolutely horrendous, the support available is next to none, there is no easy access to guidance counsellors, any email you send through email it was rarely answered, and when I asked multiple times about switching course they never gave me guidance on it, so I just made a new application and was told I'd be updated within a week, 5 approx weeks pass and I decide to email them, they blamed me because they left me a voice mail, that I never seen because it literally said, and I quote ""All official communication regarding your application will be by email"". The course I could have been in is now full and I'm extremely disappointed. Not only that, they then told me I would have had to complete a transfer form since I was a current student, would have been great if there was ANYWHERE I could have learned that but there wasn't, nothing on the website and no replies when I asked them directly.

Makes effort to assist the international students to have a swift transition and settle in the community. Always checking on them, not just on the academic section, but general well being.

They have state of the art classrooms, highly educated and friendly tutors, automatic gym membership for students, provision of accomodation, transport service from Dublin to Cork upon resumption. Arranges international meetings. There are endless reasons for one to choose this school including the location in a friendly city. I love University College Cork Γ¥ñ∩╕Å.
