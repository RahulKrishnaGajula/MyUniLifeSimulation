Consequently, there is a strong demand for graduates with a scientific understanding of environmental and health and safety issues, together with a full knowledge of technological and management methods available to help improve the quality of our environment. What makes Environmental Science at the University of Limerick distinctive is its relevance to industry and business, through a focus on environmental technology, environmental management and health & safety in the workplace. Having followed a broad common first year, you will be provided with a strong foundation in biology, chemistry and ecology, and with an in-depth knowledge in environmental technology, environmental management, conservation and waste management. The main areas of study will include Environmental Science - the application of the fundamental sciences to environmental issues Environmental Management - how strategies can be developed and implemented to protect and sustain all aspects of the environment Clean Technology - the use of cleaner technologies and processes to minimise the negative impacts of technology on the environment Waste Management - the study of the physical methodologies and techniques for dealing with increasing levels of waste generated by the manufacturer and consumer Health & Safety - a complementary area to environmental science which specifically deals with significant health and safety issues both in the workplace and in outdoor environments.","The degree programme is four years in duration. Early modules are concerned with building up your understanding of core science relevant to the environment (biology, ecology, chemistry, computing, mathematics and physics) as well as core subjects in Environmental Science. The basic concepts used in these subjects are applied to specific environmental science applications. Later modules in the programme focus on the areas of environmental management, environmental technology, environmental impact assessment, geographical information systems, waste management, sustainability and conservation ecology environmental monitoring and health & safety. In the third year, the University organises Cooperative Education for all students. This is a period of approximately eight months of paid employment for you in a position which is relevant to environmental science. This placement benefits you in a number of ways in that it: facilitates you in applying techniques and knowledge acquired in the University to the workplace environment, provides you with significant environmental experience which may be of help when seeking a position on graduation, and gives you the opportunity to work as part of a team to solve real problems in the workplace. In the final year of the programme, you will undertake a research project in some aspect of environmental science. The project is supervised by an academic member of staff with specific expertise in the area and the project runs over both semesters","Applicants are required to hold at the time of enrolment the established Leaving Certificate (or an approved equivalent) with a minimum of six subjects which must include: Two H5 (Higher Level) grades and Four O6 (Ordinary Level) grades or four H7 (Higher Level) grades.

In order to learn about nature it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. This language is mathematics. A physicist uses the tools of experiment and mathematics to uncover the relationships found in nature as Physics. Physicists get to ask the big questions and their work enables them to form answers. Physics describes the Universe from the very largest size (of the Universe itself) to the very small sizes of atoms and even subatomic particles. By asking and answering these big questions rather than simply observing nature, physicists can use the knowledge gained to control natural phenomena in the form of technology. Albert Einstein’s development of General Relativity in the early 20th century was initially used to describe gravity around large celestial bodies such as the Sun, galaxies or even black holes. Einstein’s theory has found modern-day application in the Global Positioning System (GPS) that many of us regularly use to navigate our journeys. Without Einstein’s theory, and the physicists who understood it, GPS would simply not have worked. Quantum Mechanics was developed by physicists to describe the smallest of objects; atoms and subatomic particles. Physicists then identifed how to control the flow of electrons in matter. This work has led directly to the development of modern digital computers. When you use your computer/mobile device you are using the technologies initially developed by physicists. The examples described above involved developing a theory in Physics from conception through to a technological application. Physicists are part of this process at every step from theory to application. This flexibility for physicists in the workplace is one of the strengths of a Physics degree. A Physics degree imparts knowledge of the physical world, along with strong mathematical and problem-solving skills. Physicists also have a broad knowledge of subjects that other disciplines would find dificult to match including Quantum Mechanics, Optics, Thermal Physics, Electromagnetism, Semiconductors, Solid State Physics, and Nanotechnology. The detailed knowledge of these areas ensures that good physics graduates will always be in demand by industry. Physicists can also undertake research in either industry or academia. Faculty in the Department of Physics are actively involved in research in areas such as: Flow batteries for large scale energy storage, Using light to transmit information rather than electrons in wires (Nanoplasmonics), Computational modelling of assemblies comprising millions of atoms to determine properties of various materials, Using electron microscopy to determine the structure of nanoscale materials and to investigate novel 2-D materials like graphene, Microelectromechanical structures and devices for biomedical applications. In your final year of study you will undertake a project working on these or other topics alongside and guided by established researchers in the Department.","In the first semester, you will study topics in physics including mechanics, heat, electricity, magnetism, and methods of measurement. You will also study general chemistry and topics in mathematics including linear algebra and calculus.

Biomedical engineers are involved in the design and creation of medical devices, implants such as stents, instruments and materials for clinical use. They also apply their engineering skills to problems in human biology and are at the forefront of developments in human medicine in the 21st century, enabling the medicial profession to diagnose and treat disease, and repair or replace damaged living tissue.  This degree programme was developed as a result of the need within the biomedical industry for highly skilled personnel. Locally based biomedical companies, of which there is a significant cluster, were involved in its design. It therefore remains highly relevant to the needs of industry while giving students a full training in engineering design principles and their application to human biology in an interdisciplinary environment. Related, relevant subjects that are covered over the course of the degree programme include biomedical instrumentation, tissue engineering and biomechanics.  If you want an interesting career that involves the application of engineering principles to medicine and biology, this may suit you. Biomedical engineers assist clinicians to analyse and solve problems in biology and medicine, therby helping to sustain or improve life. Both traditional and modern engineering principles and new technology are used. Biomedical engineers are also challenged to ensure that advances in technology keep pace with the advances in medicine and that the diagnostic, life-support or life-enhancing tools they create remain compatible with the human body.","At the School of Engineering we are focused on ensuring that you will be educated to the highest standards, and will have the necessary qualifications to avail of all of the professional opportunities presented to you, both in Ireland and across the world.

The BSc in Project and Construction Management is an interdisciplinary degree programme, providing students with an extensive training in both construction management and project management, essential managerial aspects to carrying out large, complex projects in industry. This degree programme prepares graduates for taking on technical, management, academic and research/development level positions in the construction industry, as well as across a range of other industries such as in the bio-pharmaceutical, technology and science industries.  Despite the downturn in the economy, construction remains hugely important as an industry and there is an ever-present need for skilled and resourceful project managers, nationally and internationally, as companies seek to carry out projects as efficiently and effectively as possible. The construction industry has seen many rapid changes in recent years, with the advent of new technologies and the extensive use of computer-based techniques. Added to this are developments in new materials with enhanced performance and new construction techniques. There is also the interdisciplinary challenge, with a blurring of boundaries taking place between traditional roles, both in construction and other areas requiring highly developed managerial skills in the overseeing of complex projects.   Becoming a project and construction manager will mean you will be trained in the fundamentals of civil engineering, construction, and business and economics. You will learn about managerial and accounting principles, get an introduction to human resources management and progress to getting an insight into the concepts of financial management. Other focuses over the four-year programme are health and safety law, quality management and planning, which is evolving to take account of changing environmental concerns, and sustainability issues. The course will provide you with the capacity to critically analyse and apply problem solving skills across a growing and diverse number of construction specialisms.",Required CE141: Introduction to Engineering and Design - 15 Credits - Semester 1 Required MA1161: Mathematical Studies - 10 Credits - Semester 1 Required MG1100: Contemporary Management Thought - 5 Credits - Semester 1 Required AY104: Introduction to Financial Accounting - 5 Credits - Semester 1 Required CT1110: Engineering Computing I - 5 Credits - Semester 1 Required EI160: Engineering Graphics - 5 Credits - Semester 1 Required MG1101: Management and Enterprise - 5 Credits - Semester 1 Required AY105: Introduction to Management Accounting - 5 Credits - Semester 2 Required CE119: Fundamentals of Project & Construction Management - 5 Credits - Semester 2 Required PH150: Introduction to Physics - 5 Credits - Semester 2 Year 2 (60 Credits) Required CE2101: Principles of Building - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required CE227: Strength of Materials - 10 Credits - Semester 3 Required AY207: Management Accounting I - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required LW3114: Introduction to Law - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required IE225: Project Planning and Organisation - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required CE2100: Building Information Modelling - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required ST2001: Statistics for Data Science 1 - 5 Credits - Semester 3 Required CE2103: Construction Practice - 5 Credits - Semester 4 Required CE2102: Community Engaged Building Project - 5 Credits - Semester 4 Required ME5105: Fundamentals of Operations Engineering - 5 Credits - Semester 4 Required CE222: Civil Engineering Materials and Design - 5 Credits - Semester 4 Year 3 (60 Credits) Required CE3109: Professional Practice in Project & Construction Management - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required CE3104: Design of Structures II - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required CE343: Sustainable Energy - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required EC5133: Principles of Economics for Business - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required ME5102: Quality Systems - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required CE334: Construction Operations - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required MG328: Human Resource Management - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required IE309: Operations Research - 5 Credits - Semester 5 Required ME353: Quality Systems - 5 Credits - Semester 6 Required CE3103: Design of Structures I - 5 Credits - Semester 6 Required CE471: Project Management - 5 Credits - Semester 6 Required CE3108: Professional Experience Programme in Project and Construction Management - 5 Credits - Semester 6 Required CE338: Project Planning & Organisation II - 5 Credits - Semester 6 Year 4 (60 Credits) Required EC2100: Applied Microeconomics for Business - 5 Credits - Semester 7 Required CE447: Final Year Project - 10 Credits - Semester 7 Required CE3105: Environmental Engineering - 5 Credits - Semester 7 Required IE448: Safety & Construction - 5 Credits - Semester 7 Required ME432: Technology Innovation & Entrepreneurship - 5 Credits - Semester 7 Required IE450: Lean Systems - 5 Credits - Semester 7 Required CE471: Project Management - 5 Credits - Semester 8 Required MG2101: Entrepreneurial Venture Development - 5 Credits - Semester 8 Required CE468: Estimates and Costing - 5 Credits - Semester 8 Required LW290: Business Law II - 5 Credits - Semester 8 Required CE476: The Built Environment - 5 Credits - Semester 8,"Entry Requirements Minimum Grade H5 in two subjects and passes in four other subjects at O6/H7 Level in the Leaving Certificate, including Irish, English, Mathematics, and either Laboratory Sciences subject (such as Agricultural Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Chemistry (joint), Physics or Computer Science), Technology, Engineering, Design and Communication Graphics or Construction Studies, and any other subjects recognised for entry purposes.
