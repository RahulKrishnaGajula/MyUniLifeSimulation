The course is examined using a combination of continuous assessment of both theory and practical work, and end of year examinations.\n\nThis honours degree is recognised by the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland for membership (MICI); graduates are also eligible to apply for Associate Membership of the Royal Society of Chemistry (AMRSC).","3":"The first year curriculum is common for all degrees in the Department of Computer Science, MTU Bishopstown Campus. All first year students study the same modules and this means that students can transfer to another programme within the Department in year two if they meet the CAO entry requirements for that programme when they enter MTU Bishopstown Campus, Cork. This offers great flexibility for qualifying students who may wish to change programmes after year one. This flexibility allows a student to make a more informed decision one year into their studies.\n\nOverview\nThe programme provides students with the knowledge, skills and competencies in IT infrastructure, security, emerging technologies, systems management, database systems and IT applications. The programme is designed around five key strategic pillars; Networking, Security, Cloud Computing Technologies, Scripting and Database Systems. The students who enrol on this programme will study modules aligned to the above areas.\n\nStudents will also learn about Information Security, a rapidly expanding sector in the computer industry. As more technology goes online, students will learn how secure private and sensitive information is most at risk from cyberattacks. The aim of the degree is to produce graduates with skills in IT infrastructure, operating systems, systems administration, cloud computing technologies and cybersecurity. Graduates will be able to design, deploy and administer virtualised environments, deploy and configure networks, and secure IT infrastructures and IT Systems. At a time of increasing reliance on IT services, the demand for graduates with the skills to implement and maintain IT infrastructure remains high. This programme is specifically designed to address this need.\n\nIn Year 3, work placement runs from January. Placements for students are organised on a country-wide basis with a particular focus on Cork and Dublin. Students can also work abroad.","4":"Overview\nMotor vehicle technology and the motor industry in general have undergone dramatic changes in recent times. Technological advances have made vehicles more efficient, more environmentally friendly, and safer, whilst at the same time strict standards are being enforced by manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\nThe motor and transport industries require highly qualified people at supervisory and management level. This course is designed to take account of these advances and it prepares graduates for employment within such a dynamic industry.\n\nThe course has a unique combination of theoretical and applied areas of study in conjunction with relevant business subjects. This course aims to provide the graduate with the practical, analytical, managerial, and interpersonal skills necessary for a successful career within the automotive industry.\n\nThe course is taught through a combination of lectures, practical work and assignments related to practical aspects, e.g. motor vehicle technology, garage practice, automobile electronics, advanced diagnostics, CAD\/vehicle design, etc.\n\nGraduates will have a comprehensive understanding of the wider business and economic context which the automotive sector operates within, and an appreciation of the importance of high ethical standards within the automotive sector.","5":"Overview\nNautical science has three main elements: navigation, cargo operations, and ship handling. In other words, the control of a ship; the safe operation of a ship, including the protection of life and the environment; Shipboard administration, and the handling, loading and care of cargoes which may be as diverse as petroleum products, general cargo, or thousands of new cars or passengers.\n\nThis course is designed for those who wish to pursue a career as a deck officer aboard ship.
