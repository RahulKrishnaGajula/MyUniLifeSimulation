    "course_description": "Biomedical Engineering is a relatively new branch of engineering that involves the use of cutting-edge technologies to help improve human healthcare. Biomedical engineers are involved in the design and creation of medical devices, implants such as stents, instruments and materials for clinical use. They also apply their engineering skills to problems in human biology and are at the forefront of developments in human medicine in the 21st century, enabling the medicial profession to diagnose and treat disease, and repair or replace damaged living tissue.\n\nThis degree programme was developed as a result of the need within the biomedical industry for highly skilled personnel. Locally based biomedical companies, of which there is a significant cluster, were involved in its design. It therefore remains highly relevant to the needs of industry while giving students a full training in engineering design principles and their application to human biology in an interdisciplinary environment. Related, relevant subjects that are covered over the course of the degree programme include biomedical instrumentation, tissue engineering and biomechanics.\n\nIf you want an interesting career that involves the application of engineering principles to medicine and biology, this may suit you. Biomedical engineers assist clinicians to analyse and solve problems in biology and medicine, therby helping to sustain or improve life. Both traditional and modern engineering principles and new technology are used. Biomedical engineers are also challenged to ensure that advances in technology keep pace with the advances in medicine and that the diagnostic, life-support or life-enhancing tools they create remain compatible with the human body.",

    "course_description": "Civil Engineering is concerned with the planning, design, construction and maintenance of the built environment. It encompasses minor and major structures, ranging from drainage systems, houses, commercial buildings, roads and bridges to multi-story buildings and water and wastewater treatment facilities. The work of civil engineers is most visible in the structures in which we live and work. Their contribution is also seen in transportation systems that we use on a daily basis such as subways, motorways, railways, airports and harbours. They are also involved in the design, construction and operation of complex water supply and sanitation systems for our ever-growing cities. In such projects and more generally, they perform a critical public and environmental health function as well.\n\nThe Civil Engineering degree programme sets out to develop the scientific, technical, organisational, IT and communication skills needed for a satisfying and rewarding career as a Civil Engineer.\n\nCivil Engineers work in rapidly changing and challenging areas using traditional and new materials and techniques, and increasingly incorporating IT solutions at design and construction stage. You could be involved in schemes from design to management stage through to completion in what are often highly complex projects. Therefore, the profession combines creative skills with an aptitude for mathematics and technical subjects. At the most challenging end of the profession, where the management of large projects is involved, a high degree of administration skills are also required.\n\nIf you think you might enjoy developing and constructing bridges, tunnels, roads, railways, major building or other infrastructural projects, you should consider Civil Engineering. The skills you will learn will give you opportunities for work worldwide wherever development is taking place; not least in the fast-growing economies of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).",

Mechanical engineers design the tools and processes necessary to create all man-made products, and are often involved from conceiving of an idea right through to seeing it as a finished product ready for its commercial application. They design everything you think of as a device or machine. Devices used in engines, the components used in transportation, power conversion equipment, like the steam and wind turbines used in modern electric power plants, and processing equipment used in oil and gas rigs all come within the remit of the mechanical engineer.\n\nIf you think you have or can develop the skills and knowledge to understand the requirements for designing a moving device or machine for the environment it will be used in as well as understand how it will best be manufactured, then you may make a good mechanical engineer. This degree programme is designed to provide graduates with the skills to face the challenge for newer, better, faster, more reliable, more versatile, longer-lasting and more environmentally friendly products and processes. These skills need also to be complemented by the managerial and personal skills needed to interact with teams on joint projects.  \n\nLearning about Mechanical Engineering will help you to develop your creative side, a part of your thinking that will enable you to design a new product or system and the analytical skills to make it a reality. You will also learn about the value of the teamwork skills that go into the successful production of most devices and processes used in today's world.

    "course_description": "Over the past few decades, construction management has developed into a specific and necessary role within the construction industry as projects have increased in size and complexity and the need to deliver them in a timely, efficient manner has become critical. The BSc in Project and Construction Management is an interdisciplinary degree programme, providing students with an extensive training in both construction management and project management, essential managerial aspects to carrying out large, complex projects in industry. This degree programme prepares graduates for taking on technical, management, academic and research/development level positions in the construction industry, as well as across a range of other industries such as in the bio-pharmaceutical, technology and science industries.\n\nDespite the downturn in the economy, construction remains hugely important as an industry and there is an ever-present need for skilled and resourceful project managers, nationally and internationally, as companies seek to carry out projects as efficiently and effectively as possible. The construction industry has seen many rapid changes in recent years, with the advent of new technologies and the extensive use of computer-based techniques. Added to this are developments in new materials with enhanced performance and new construction techniques. There is also the interdisciplinary challenge, with a blurring of boundaries taking place between traditional roles, both in construction and other areas requiring highly developed managerial skills in the overseeing of complex projects.\n\n Becoming a project and construction manager will mean you will be trained in the fundamentals of civil engineering, construction, and business and economics. You will learn about managerial and accounting principles, get an introduction to human resources management and progress to getting an insight into the concepts of financial management. Other focuses over the four-year programme are health and safety law, quality management and planning, which is evolving to take account of changing environmental concerns, and sustainability issues. The course will provide you with the capacity to critically analyse and apply problem solving skills across a growing and diverse number of construction specialisms.",

Only one of MA180 (tailored for students who may wish to consider a degree specialism in mathematics or data science) and MA161 (which guides students in analytic skills required for scientists) may be taken. The combination of modules chosen in Year 1 will be important as requirements in selecting focused pathways of study from Year 2. First year students will have an advisory session to aid in module selection, and further information and guidance can be found in the 1st year student handbook.\n\nYear 1 modules are supported by lectures, which provide discussion and demonstration of topics, by tutorials or workshops, and by practical classes offering extensive and hands-on laboratory experience. Students are supported by the C�IM shared peer learning initiative, by the SUMS Centre (Support for Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics) and an Advisory Scheme in which each student has a contact point with an academic staff member to help answer general queries throughout their first year.\n\nYear 2\nIn Year 2 of the programme students begin a specialised path of study. Modules are grouped by focused themes providing a pathway toward a specialism. Students can study up to three pathways in Year 2, where eligibility for the pathways depends on the combination of modules chosen in Year 1. Note that places on some pathways are limited �  advisory sessions are provided, during which pathway advisors will be available to discuss module options.\n\n \n\n Years 3 and 4\nIn year 3 of the programme students continue their focused paths of study, retaining up to two pathways, choosing a single specialism in either Year 3 or Year 4.
