   "course_description": "The objective of the Masters in Cybersecurity Operations is to educate IT practitioners in responding to cyber-attack incidents. It examines the tools to identify threat actors. Models and frameworks are followed to manage the response. Data analytics can use tools such as machine learning to identify anomalies in organisational IT traffic.\n\nCybersecurity Operations involves implementing secure architecture to defend against vulnerable systems. It can be considered the stage when risk and compliance has failed.\n\nThis Masters provides a pathway for IT professionals to upskill in the area of cybersecurity operations. Developed in partnership with HPE, a learner can pursue a major L9 award through 4 x 10 credit taught modules and completing a 50-credit thesis",
   "course_content": "The taught modules are delivered in year one of the Masters and prepares the learner for independent, delt-directed thesis research in the domain of cybersecurity operations  \n\nIncident Detection & Response (10 Credits) \n\nWhen Risk & Compliance fails, an organization must respond to cyber incidents. All IT practitioners and security operations personnel need to have the skills to systematically neutralize a threat. These steps include identifying a threat, employing quarantine measures and implementing robust measures to mitigate against future compromises. Engineering models and frameworks such as Mitre ATT&CK are explored as a means of analysing organisational data, identifying mitigating threats. \n\nProgramming for Data Analytics (10 Credits) \n\nIncident detection identifies threat actors operating within an organization�s IT infrastructure. Using data analytic tools and machine learning, IT security personnel can forensically examine and identify anomalous activity, potentially being a malicious threat. Coding is an integral part of designing bespoke analytical tools and this module explores the programming languages necessary for data interpretation and visualisation.  \n\nSecure Operations (10 Credits) \n\nAn organization endeavours to secure its IT architecture against threats. Vulnerability management ensures elements of this architecture are configured and secured correctly. Implementing robust defences is the best method to mitigate against these threats. Preparedness for an incident is as important as incident response. \n\nResearch Methods and Critical Analysis (10 Credits) \n\nTheoretical concepts, research paradigms and critical readings relevant to the field of academic or professional applied research will be explored. Epistemological and ontological considerations will be discussed in relation to research design and learners will reflect on the challenges of carrying out empirical social research in their particular workplace or specialist field of application. Students will reflect upon some of the ethical, societal and practical problems of data collection, including sampling, gaining access to the field, designing a research instrument and the principles of qualitative and quantitative analysis.  \n\n \n\nThe Thesis or Dissertation can be pursued in parallel with the year two modules and completed in year two. \n\nThesis/Dissertation (50 Credits) \n\nThis applied research thesis or dissertation module provides the mechanism for learners to carry out an in-depth, independent investigation, analysis and presentation of a research topic; organisational or workplace innovation dilemma of their choosing, related to the relevant academic discipline and/or professional field. This Applied Research Project or Dissertation module requires the learner to conceptualise, design, conduct, analyse and formally write up, then visually / orally present a substantial research project or workplace innovation/intervention to postgraduate research standard.
