It has a sort of family atmosphere where everyone plays an important role. Classes are smaller and more personal so lecturers go to a special effort to teach everyone at all levels, individually. The facilities for students are exemplary with only a short walk between all.

104,Student,"My experience with Trinity College totally falls under the overall discomfort related to the pandemic. Due to COVID, I've never been able to visit neither the campus nor the city of Dublin, so I invite you to consider my words accordingly. I did not appreciate how the university handled the whole thing. I paid a lot of money to take part to an MPhil I am not very happy to have attended. The professors were very good, but the institution made me feel alone, abandoned. For someone who could not go outside due to the restrictions, the workload revealed to be quite heavy: I went burnout almost twice and event went to the hospital. Moreover, the digital library services were insufficient, so I had to find ""colorful"" ways to retrieve material to write my dissertation. No, we did not have a discount. Last but not least, my degree was not specialising at all, and I spent eight months sending hundreds of curricula.
Happy to have stayed at home, the student housing cost was ridiculous anyways.",2.2,5,2014,https://www.studentcrowd.com/university-l1054971-s1054985-trinity-college-dublin-dublin,www.studentcrowd.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,0
105,Student,"I feel like I graduated despite how the programme was structured, not by benefiting from the academic excellence Trinity likes to brag about. Professors seemed swamed by their work as researchers - which advances their careers more than teaching - and the educational experience suffers greatly under this. Seminars were often little more than research papers verbally summarised by a professor with lack of interest in teaching being evident. Feedback on papers in the Master program that I did was often just a number slapped on a submission months after the deadline. When I ocasionally asked for clarification I received either snappy or no responses at all. Other annoyances are a lack of seating spaces to eat, effectively forcing you to spend money in the canteen if you want to stay warm and dry. As a graduate I thus reach this conclusion: If you want a good name on your CV, study at Trinity. If you want an engaging educational experience, consider other options.",2.8,5,2014,https://www.studentcrowd.com/university-l1054971-s1054985-trinity-college-dublin-dublin,www.studentcrowd.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,0

The first two years were exhausting trying to pander to Trinity students who tend to be pretty well off and not very inclusive, and I found it very hard to make genuine friends. There was no full time professors in my department, just lecturers who come in for an hour or two a day other than that the building is empty. In first year I had ten hours a week, and the hours went down ever year so that in my final year I had just 5 hours a week plus a 10 minute zoom slot to talk about my portfolio.

Students Union 3/5, often disengaged from SU likely due to distance, SU and faculty miscommunications leading to disruption of student services occurring during my time.

159,Student,"As an international student from the U.S., Trinity was a great university, full of opportunities to meet new people and engage with the Dublin community. The academic atmosphere took a bit of time to understand as the grading system differs from the US, but the classes were of excellent quality, and the use of tutorials and seminars allowed us to explore our subjects in greater depth.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest drawbacks of TCD is its partial disregard for international students in particular. The cost (though less than many U.S. institutions) is roughly x4 the Irish national rate. Paired with the unnecessarily difficult immigration permission process each year and poor communication within the academic registry, there is a significant burden of stress placed on (non-EU) international students.

Nevertheless, my time at Trinity has been worth the chaos, and I am grateful for the experience that fostered many of my most cherished memories and closest friendships.",4,5,2017,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

166,Student,"A big concept for Irish institutions is that there are little to no gen-eds unless you take a Broad Curriculum module. This leads to a great, expert-level understanding of your major, but if you want more of a general knowledge degree, Trinity might not be the best for you. Also, as Trinity is the largest, most well-known university in Ireland, they are very conscious of their image. As a result, decisions that the more modern students would disagree with are chosen by the administration in order to appear PC. WARNING: Trinity is not wheel-chair friendly AT ALL unless you have someone there to help you - especially if you're near the STEM (back) side of campus.

On the student life side, TCD has a lot of clubs and societies for students to choose from, from our two debating societies (the Hist and the Phil) to QSoc -
our LGBTQIA+ society to Food and Drink Society to Judo - there's a society or club for anyone and everyone in Trinity (and if there isn't, you can always make one!)",4,5,2019,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

170,Student,"If you want the traditional American college experience relating to Athletics, you should probably consider a traditional American college. There are certainly sports available at Trinity if you want to pursue them but they're not central to the culture of the school nor do you even really notice them on a daily basis. The athletics facilities are quite new and seem (based upon my *very* limited experience with them) modern, clean, etc... and easy to use. They're also relatively inexpensive compared to a monthly gym membership or even other Dublin colleges like UCD. Returning to sports though, if you want to participate in them, you do so through clubs and societies. Thus, you sign up for rugby club if you want to play rugby or the Hockey club if you want to play hockey. From what I know of these clubs, some of them are thinly veiled drinking societies especially in the lower quality teams whereas others are quite competitive.",3,5,2019,https://www.niche.com/colleges/trinity-college-dublin/reviews/,www.niche.com,Trinity College Dublin,Trinity College Dublin,1

My name is Rashi. I completed my master├ås from ucd in the year 2015 and i cherish every single learning from that place.
I was always into small things like save water, plant more trees, reduce energy consumption, no to plastic, recycling paper and many more. UCD├ås intercultural environment and the new approaches i noticed was the most interesting at first. Later my master gave me a huge opportunity to learn the news ways and technology to save earth Or basically to save us.
The reduction for plastic can be done at verious level of its life. Therefore LCA (life cycle assessment ) modules were of great knowledge.
The reduction of energy consumption and conservation for the animal and plant farming were also very important and new to me.

210,Kauri Maher,"I studied in this university for 5 years from 2014 - 2019, and what an excellent education I received here. I graduated with a 1:1 Bachelors of Agricultural science degree (Specialising in Horticulture and Landscape mgt) OK WELL... Educational facilities, e.g laboratories, classrooms, computer rooms, tutorials, studios, Library, ag testing sites....are next level, 1st class ++++ Educational staff: A++ were really great, very helpful, understanding, good presenters, extremely knowledgeable, links with Industry etc... Course content: very thorough, applicable to industry A+ Campus: B-..........A lot of people complain about the campus, but tbh its very green, well maintained, two lakes, open air, safe, bright. My only gripe would be there are not enough places to hang out/congregate!! its almost too big, in a weird way XD Club & Societies- A+++ Absolutely incredible. i got really involved with the mountaineering club, Horticulture society and rowing team too :) so much to offer, they add so much value, easy way to meet new people!!! amazing fun. Social life: GRADE C......I found it really difficult to meet new friends here (and I know many many others that did)...i really had a hard time integrating and i'm not a shy, or introverted person at all. Although I met many people I only made like 2 real friends in 4 years which is kinda dissapointing. I was so desperate to fit in, but I never could, I still dunno why to this day. Many of my friends went to TCD, DCU and trinity made so many new friends and life long friends...but there is something about UCD that makes it hard to make real friends. In the first 3 months, lots of people form a clique that they stick with for the next 4 years and if you aren't in a clique by then, well then good luck. I knew a lot of lonely people here, some even dropped out because of it. I mean I was very lonely for periods in UCD. The bar at UCD, isn't much craic at all, got a weird layout and pretty small for the size of UCD. it was the last day on campus, and they were playing live music and everyone was standing there like fools. So it ended being just me and two punk guys that danced XD beer is expensive too, like regular prices. (DONT GET ME WRONG, You will be friendly and have 'uni friends' yes, but long term mates, outside of campus, im not sure) This really is my only gripe, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 4!!! BUT STILL, VERY GRATFEFUL FOR MY EDUCATION HERE, and it was a fantastic experience all the same. I leave you with a great photo from HORTICULTURE SOCIETY (Which I managed for 2 years) and mountaineering party and Rosemount, !

It shows they drastically missed the part of forward thinking while designing such a great organisation. As I am talking about design, the design of auditorium is a disaster. I cannot comprehend how someone with a right mind, with right experience, with right education, with right interest may design, get approval, build such a mess!

At the time, Ireland was in the middle of a recession, and we were totally unprepared for what was to come with totally impractical courses, such as sub editing with a ruler and a calculator. There were also enforced courses on philosophy which were utterly useless in the newsroom. They owed more to the professor's academic interest. There were some glimmers of light in a dark year, I found the late Eddie Holt brilliant. I also must speak very highly of the Intra office, who were marvellous which gives two stars. The campus is ugly and small in grey North Dublin. I feel there are infinitely better MA Journalism options elsewhere, however things may have changed.

245,MeWithTheFuture,"I don't wanna be biased in my verdict, but providing review on the university system could be subjective not necessary following on standardised rules. I'd say my experience with DCU was not the best. The teachers and assistant teachers are complicating the things in old fashion they thought it is academic standard. Some of them really didn't know how to discuss and elaborate simple basic theories instead they preferred to post YouTube or other links to let the students watch it. Be careful with the description of the modules because it is not extensively providing details in terms of prerequisites and level of studying of the students. If you are coming from non English speaking country as a first language then perhaps the grades of your bachelor or master would be downgraded due to grammar mistakes even if your English is superb and passed ILETS with highest grades. Some teachers are using this way to reduce your overall grades. conversely, I have seen a lot of mistakes and proof -reading from many teachers as well. I have experienced many mistakes in my grades from DCU however I preferred first to point it out to my coordinator rather than suing them. During academic sessions, I have spotted many mistakes from the the module' s coordinator, however I was not appreciative instead the professor didn't solve any problems in the tutorial letting the students to solve everything without even final answers because there was non trust to share the answers which somehow could expose the weakness of the material. In addition to the mistakes of the principles used by the professor for the record all of the problems were taken from internet. I was disappointed I realized it would be much better for me to learn myself on my own pace. Last thing, maybe you will be lucky with other schools in DCU if they are not reluctant to better ways of education system, the management and teachers need to engage with other system globally to see the difference and find widen scope to develop themselves.

We arrived at 7.40pm and 10 minutes later we were still trying to find a free parking space.The main car park was full. We were unable to access the other car parks as entry was blocked by a lowered barrier. This was annoying and disappointing. Our advice is to arrive earlier than usual to secure your parking.

377,Cleiton Nunes,"DBS was the worst institution I've studied my whole life, even considering that I did a previous degree in a ""third-world country"". Having professional experience in the field I've chosen to study at DBS and also having a previous degree on the same area I can tell that main topics of important modules are not given to the students in my class. There are lecturers with an amazing professional CV or even great career achievements, but at the same time I've seen people learning or understanding nothing from them, even different groups would tell they couldn't follow the classes. One of those terrible lecturers once refused to give explanations or clarify the topics ""explained"". The college has no transparency with the students and all information given ate mostly not accurate or incomplete. I was January intake and my class just found out we were not having holidays 1 month before the end of our classes, at the same time that we were taken by surprise by the college saying we would have to pay earlier than expected.

378,Sam Mathew,Not a bad college to be fairly honest but could do better with how they approach teaching. Lectures are seen in a boring light by the majority anyway so lecturers could bring a bit more enthusiasm and chip to the classroom and engage with the students more rather than just read off PowerPoint slides (we could do that at home if we wanted). Support provided by Admin staff is however stellar. Any requests and advice is provided promptly so kudos to that.

Even if you reach out to some of them on email, you probably wont get a response for weeks at a time. One of our lecturers have been amazing and I would love if they all followed the same process as her however that is not the case. When spending enormous amounts of money on an ╬ô├ç├┐education Id expect appropriate conduct, teaching and resources yet this is not the case. On top of that if you miss a class even though they are all recorded, it seems some lecturers will hold a grudge, which is sad in fact. We all have busy lives just trying to get by so if the class of recorded why should being present at the time matter? Why dont you find lecturers who actually have a passion for teaching? Instead you take ones on who already have multiple jobs resulting in them neglecting their students, teaching process and results.

My only bad experience I had there was they didn't really help you find internship during the third year. The issue is that college doesn't reach out to software companies to build relationships so these companies are willing to take on students for internships. It's up to you to find one. There was a class that was supposed to help us to find jobs but it was useless as the lecturer didn't care.

430,Conor Nolan,"Course studied: BA Business Blended study Currently in my second year of the three year degree Working full-time, I had completely written off any chance that I would study at third level. The month before I applied to Griffith I had watched my friends graduate from their respective studies and I really felt like Id missed out. When I read about blended learning on the Griffith website, I ended up feeling like I'd stumbled across this amazing secret. Before applying, I was worried that working full-time would make it impossible to study without becoming a hermit. The truth is, you can actually keep a great balance if you make a plan early and stick to it. The blended learning approach involves weekly video lectures and webinars with monthly workshops delivered on Saturdays. The other students in my course are great, everyone works together to help one another, in particular around exam time. You're surrounded by other students in your exact position and the support network of students and lecturers help you stay on top of things. It can be challenging at times when work and college, unbeknownst to one another, get busier simultaneously. If, like me you plan on studying while working full-time, I would definitely recommend you have the conversation with work early and keep them in the loop. Once you can communicate with your employer what's going on with college, it can be much easier to harmonize work and study. Blended learning at Griffith has enabled me to study at third level and progress in my career before I've even graduated. Its a great feeling when you can apply what you've studied in college, at work. Balancing work and college brings a structure to my life and helps keep me focused. Im halfway through my degree now and I'm really proud of how far I've come. My biggest regret was that I didnt start blended study sooner.",5,5,01-01-2019,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116644202622208860213/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARBE,www.google.com,Griffith College,"S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland",1

443,B M,Very helpful staff at CIT. Various programs are offered and International students are welcome. Theres quite a number of students from the Erasmus program. Students can find accommodation easily. Theres plenty of places to eat inside the campus that offers delicious meals and with low prices.

445,Ahmed Kabir,"Munster Technological University (MTU) is a well ranked university in Cork, Ireland. Faculty of Engineering is very popular. MSc. in Data science under dept. of Mathematics is one the cheaper one year course . Plenty of Indian students studying data science and getting good jobs, once graduated. Professors are highly profiled and offering graduate studentship or PhD positions to talented student. Also, significant number of scholarships for native and foreign students which cover both the tuition fees and living expenses. All prospective student please keep in mind that don't through garbage email or CV to professors. Organized your CV and email like a professional and I bet you will get a positive feed back. MTU is also friendly for foreign students. There is a football ground and Gymnasium for sports and exercise. The bus no. 205 is going to city center from MTU. Free toilets are located in each floor in each building but only accessible for students and staffs. However, strangers might sneak in and can use the toilet too. Enough students accommodations to accommodate large number of students but expensive! Student can also rent and share house outside which is relatively cheaper. The main problem is that there are no large groceries shops nearby, therefore, need to walk or take the bus. There is a Indian groceries shops called Spice town (16 Uam Var Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, T12 HWX3) but pretty bit far from MTU by walking.",5,5,01-01-2021,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105812569133654134650/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARAY,www.google.com,Munster Technological University,"Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland",1
446,Graeme Hosford,The quality of teaching and staff is absolutely shocking. The lecturers don't seem to have a clue what they're doing half the time and seem to go out of their way to pile on unnecessary busy work with the apparent thought that their subject is the only one that matters and no regard is given to anything else which takes up our time. I'm 2 years into my course and I would advise anyone thinking of going here to just go to UCC instead it can't possibly be any less organised there. To give a few examples of the sort of thing to expect from CIT there's been plenty of times we've been a few weeks into a project or assignment and then get told the lecturer has changed their mind on what they want done forcing us to redo it either partially or totally. Overall I think the college is OK but there doesn't seem to be any review by someone in charge of what the staff are actually accomplishing which seems to be less and less which each new class.,1,5,01-01-2019,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101659637525363328439/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARBa,www.google.com,Munster Technological University,"Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland",0

Now working in digital marketing, nothing I was taught in the course was truly relevant except for the business class and web development. Flash isn't relevant to ANY industry in this day and age. If you plan on asking for a reference afterwards from the department head, forget about it. You don't even get a response to give reasons why they can't or won't. Only two lecturers were memorable for being any good out of the entire four years. Some lecturers were out because they were going in and out of rehab. You pay three grand a year to be told, go watch instructional YouTube videos. That said, easy course for someone who wants a degree for the sake of it or pleasing their parents.

The campus itself is old - very old. Some of the buildings are originals that were updated over the years. We visited one day before the fall semester started and much of the campus was under construction. It will be a surprise if they are ready for the students.

After a tour of the campus, we went to see the Book of Kells exhibit. The Book of Kells is an old bible with beautiful calligraphy and drawings. There is a nice exhibit showing the history of the book. Then you arrive at the exhibit. I admit, it was a little underwhelming since the book is behind glass and opened so you can see one page. It was not unexpected- if they allowed people to touch it, the book wouldn't last.

What I found amazing was the long hall. This was a two story library with sections dedicated to many of the classic writers, philosophers, and scientists. I think the oldest section was books by Plato.

The Long Hall is lovely, iconic, and contains icons of history.

554,Aesha,"Lots of colleges like to boast about being right in the thick of all the action. Trinity College may boast, but it's absolutely true!

I like visiting college campuses--maybe it's an occupational hazard. But there is always interesting history, beautiful buildings, and something interesting afoot at a college or university. Trinity College has all this in spades, having been established at the tail end of the 16th century. It's highly respected, considered one of the top 100 or so universities in the world. Of course there is an impressive roster of alumni.

You'll probably have come here to see the Book of Kells, probably the most famous illuminated text in the world. That would be a great idea! The book is gorgeous, truly. They give you a little bit of info as you first enter, and then let you view the pages. The book is thought to have been created around the year 800, and is largely seems to have used the Vulgate as its inspiration. It's fewer than 700 pages total, large pages of course, but still not as big as I had expected. They have four pages on display each day, and those pages rotate every once in a while. It's been divided into four volumes, so only two volumes with those four pages are on display at any given time. The pages are so intricate that you won't see everything but you can take in a lot! It's astounding how well preserved the book remains; the pages practically glow.

When you leave the Book of Kells, you'll pass through The Long Room of the Trinity College library. WOW. I think my jaw actually dropped when I stepped into this space. I mean, it's breathtaking. Truly I don't know if another library in the world could do the Book of Kells justice! Soaring, arched ceilings soft lighting. I could spend half a day wandering this space. Besides the Book of Kells, Trinity College Library holds the Brian Boru harp (you'll see harps all over Ireland--this harp is the national symbol of Ireland). Also, the library is a copyright library, which means that publishers must provide a copy of each work they publish to the library. (This is similar to the Library of Congress in the United States.)

Definitely take the time to stroll the grounds before or after you have taken in the Book of Kells and the library. The school bookstore is near the exit if you want a keepsake. I bought my Trinity college sweatshirt there and over 11 years later it still keeps me warm, and brings back memories of my time in Ireland.Useful 7Funny 3Cool 5",4,5,2022,https://www.yelp.com/biz/trinity-college-dublin-dublin-35,Yelp,Trinity College Dublin,"Trinity College, College Green Dublin",1

Trinity College offers a beautiful environment for a stroll, one of the most picturesque parts of blue collar Dublin. The grounds of luscious green lawns and colorful flowers are immaculately kept amidst pristine buildings and various works of art.

The famous Book of Kells is a vital piece of literary history and a main draw here. But the more enjoyable aspect is stepping into the library with its magnificent vaulted ceilings and endless rare books. If you heard that the directional flow of people is chaotic inside, you heard right. Multiple streams of humans converge into small doorways, but once you're in the library's main hall, you're in the clear.

Trinity College is the top-rated university in Ireland. Its academic rating (for curious Americans like us) puts it on par with the lower end of America's top 50 universities, keeping in mind that the population of Ireland is only 1% of the United States. That would give Trinity equal prestige with the likes of RPI or University of Texas, both impressive institutes in the U.S.

I feel so fortunate to have visited this historic college! It was established in 1592 as the second university (following the first created by the Pope in the 1300s). ┬áBefore our visit, I had no idea that there had been restrictions on who was admitted: and that it was first closed to Catholics (until the Catholic Emancipation in the late 1700s) without special permission. ┬áThis continued until the 1970s. Women were only admitted in the early 1900s.

There are only a few entrances. ┬áWe entered through the historic Front Gate at the College Green entrance and through the partial cobble stone walkway. ┬áWe only visited the main college ground and Parliament Square, but the campus is vast (spanning over 45 acres) and holds 25 schools. 

The great library holds over 6 million printed volumes, many of which are of a historic nature, including the famed Book of Kells, which we also had the pleasure of viewing (ticketing information here: tcd.ie/visitors/book-of-ΓÇª). Note that photos are not allowed, but the images can be viewed here (digitalcollections.tcd.iΓÇª).

The architecture is phenomenal, and ranges from historic to modern. ┬áBecause we only viewed the western portion of the campus, most of what we viewed was historic. We did see wedding pictures in progress near the Chapel, viewed the historic Campanile, saw the Examination Hall, and also saw graduates posing for photographs.

Was on a tour of Ireland and we decided to see the Book of Kells, a very significant vintage biblical collection of books which was on exhibit at one of the halls at Trinity College. The docent tour was less than an hour and informative. Due to the sensitive condition of the books, no pictures were allowed inside the temperature controlled glass encased display. The books were written in ancient 800 AD in Latin by monks in Scotland who took refugee in Ireland from prosecution. the Book of Kells is the world's most famous and oldest books. These books are smallish, by comparison to the Guggenheim Bible for reference. My recall of the details of those books escapes me, and I'll blame it on the alcohol. Yes, the alcohol, as the bulk of our trip involved touring breweries, restaurants and drinking lots of whiskey. The bartenders at the Temple Bar, loved pouring whiskey for me to sample and so I was semi conscious during this tour, basically felt like a walking zombie in my Gucci loafers.. :)

Trinity College was a nice campus and had that medieval appeal with most of the walkways in stone and building structures also resembled many castles I saw throughout the countryside of Ireland.

Importantly there's also some stellar academic work that goes on here. And whiles there's a lot that could be improved there's plenty of reasons for people to study at UCD.

When you join some of the big courses in first year undergrad, they say ""look left, look right... one of you won't be here next year""... but the story they never tell is the 1% of people who are still here in 10 years... so maybe I'm just institutionalised!!
