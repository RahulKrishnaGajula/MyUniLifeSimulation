"Karumwa Family","So we did an our final exam research methods 1 for April intake 2022 for our masters program. Exams results came out and we moved on to next semester. Only for the university to send us an email telling us we have repeat the exams done in research methods 1 because they noted some 'Academic Impropriety'. PS this was after all results have been given to the students and we have started the next semester classes. See attached. Please note they will not help in accommodation at all. Especially with the Housing crisis in Ireland- so long as you have paid school fees, they don't care. PS: other universities have campus accommodation DBS has none.

"Cleiton Nunes","DBS was the worst institution I've studied my whole life, even considering that I did a previous degree in a ""third-world country"". Having professional experience in the field I've chosen to study at DBS and also having a previous degree on the same area I can tell that main topics of important modules are not given to the students in my class. There are lecturers with an amazing professional CV or even great career achievements, but at the same time I've seen people learning or understanding nothing from them, even different groups would tell they couldn't follow the classes. One of those terrible lecturers once refused to give explanations or clarify the topics ""explained"". The college has no transparency with the students and all information given ate mostly not accurate or incomplete. I was January intake and my class just found out we were not having holidays 1 month before the end of our classes, at the same time that we were taken by surprise by the college saying we would have to pay earlier than expected. Every single staff give different informations, in a way that you talk personally, give a call, send an email and get 3 completely different answers in all your attempts.","1.0","5.0","","2 weeks ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104826878534847681798/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpg6ef5OP7AhWBEGIAHZ9nChQQvfQBegQIARBs","www.google.com","","Dublin Business School","179","3.6","13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland","ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU","https://www.google.com/search?q=dublin+business+school&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Dublin+Business+School&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j0i20i263i512j0i512l3j69i61.899j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e9de863ce97:0xd5fd5a41e4548a27,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU"
"Sam Mathew","Not a bad college to be fairly honest but could do better with how they approach teaching. Lectures are seen in a boring light by the majority anyway so lecturers could bring a bit more enthusiasm and chip to the classroom and engage with the students more rather than just read off PowerPoint slides (we could do that at home if we wanted). Support provided by Admin staff is however stellar. Any requests and advice is provided promptly so kudos to that. Amenities are a plenty since the institution is located smack right in the heart of Dublin.","3.0","5.0","","3 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104223190608949867784/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT--Of5OP7AhXXLFkFHZPzDmwQvfQBegUIARCHAQ","www.google.com","","Dublin Business School","179","3.6","13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland","ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU","https://www.google.com/search?q=dublin+business+school&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Dublin+Business+School&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j0i20i263i512j0i512l3j69i61.899j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e9de863ce97:0xd5fd5a41e4548a27,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU"

"gautham Messi","There is no option of giving no star otherwise I would have given, The college doesn't have good and well maintained website many times updated and whole things changed, you have to search for your submission, those things happen to me when I was trying to submit my assignment, submission link was gone to some other site and I end to submit in different submission link, which caused me to get fail 3rdtimes, the 2nd time results of my CA1 was not showing me,.so end up in fail, they didn't tell the reason, 3rd time my both the CA1&2 results was not showing me and again end up in fail, when I enquired about that, the respective management told me that I didn't submitted my assignment. I mailed my lecturer there is no response from them, I mailed each and every staff and again no response, the management can't find any solution for me, nothing, zero, till now I am mailing them. On the other side of my career when I got an intern opportunity but my college doesn't allow me and my ViSa status is not appropriate to do full time intern and lost the opportunity, I loose my hope of surviving here. Don't be so dump to choose and learn your career in right place, please do lots of research before filling your applications. Still I am student at DBS 2020batch and it's going to be a 3rd year for me, usually master max duration is 2year but here more than that.😂😂😂 Be careful about the fees even You won't get a ID card holder without paying some euros(cost-cutting).

"Sam Solomon","Absolute disgrace! Applied for masters and submitted everything that was required with the application including statement of results for the law degree that I completed. Along the way they requested the results again twice more and when I contacted them to see what at what stage my application was and to advise if either my application is being accepted or denied, so that I can apply elsewhere, instead they waited until after the course started 3 and a half weeks later, and sent me an email asking for results again and if I dont submit it short few hours later then they will cancel my application. Although I forward it again, they still cancel. They are lucky i havent sue them yet!

"Peter D.","Disappointment is the word which better describe the feeling to study in there. The minimum quality you expect for a master degree course is prepared professors, which is not the reality on DBS. The lectures are poor structured and you can clearly see that the professors goals are prepare you for exams and so they are not concern with your learning process or even about teach something. Several times we had a professor saying things like ""you don't need to know this, just need to recognize the formula for the exam"".

"Stephan Wagner","Honestly, stay away from it. Really poor education if you are used to any standards. One star for the nice attitude of the lecturers (if they come to uni and do not stay away without excuses) and the more or less organized administration of the college (in strong contrast to professors). Feeling robbed money and time, peace ✌🏼 edit: seeing this college is not even replying or reacting to this shows how little they care 🙃","1.0","5.0","","11 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103654733345080922792/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT--Of5OP7AhXXLFkFHZPzDmwQvfQBegQIARAC","www.google.com","","Dublin Business School","179","3.6","13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland","ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU","https://www.google.com/search?q=dublin+business+school&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Dublin+Business+School&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j0i20i263i512j0i512l3j69i61.899j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e9de863ce97:0xd5fd5a41e4548a27,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU"
"Nithin john","The Dublin business school is the most cheated institute in Dublin Ireland . This is my own personal experience 3years before I came here to study MBA programme. The management decided to make me fail in my examination for 3times due to no reason . I experience a high pressure in those times and my future career every thing is finished due to that and also my stay back finished. Now I ended up in huge mortgage (loan amount) and also I have experience the direct experience of violation . Student who studied the experience high amount of pressure and the faculties are also irresponsible and miss behaving to people ideas opportunities and plans ,several student were experience some terrible experience from lecture Shakeel siddique,enda Murphy, those time few students made complaint about there behaviour but the management never and further enquiries . The management haven't had any sense of responsibilities about the exparter students careers. Such a racist school never proud to say but even though never give any morality,kindness to student life . Student experience no further support from the institute . I suggest no one to participate there any courses I feel like I was very sad to give an late review about the general.","1.0","5.0","","6 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220032754039308506/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjpg6ef5OP7AhWBEGIAHZ9nChQQvfQBegUIARDFAQ","www.google.com","","Dublin Business School","179","3.6","13/14 Aungier St, Dublin, Ireland","ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU","https://www.google.com/search?q=dublin+business+school&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Dublin+Business+School&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j0i20i263i512j0i512l3j69i61.899j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e9de863ce97:0xd5fd5a41e4548a27,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJl85j6J0OZ0gRJ4pU5EFa_dU"
