"Nicholas Schena","Griffith College was a great opportunity for me as an American student doing a semester abroad. My program was very accommodating and the college itself offered a lot of interesting classes for me to take and create my own schedule.

"Zachary Goss","I attended and worked at Griffith College Dublin in the Alumni Office during the spring of 2019. My time there was nothing short of fantastic, as it was my first semester abroad. In a country and environment that was unfamiliar to me, I was welcomed by students, professors, and co-workers alike. Overall, the facilities were great, the professors were always willing to help whenever needed, and the faculty at Griffith College were absolutely amazing. I am glad that I was able to truly experience Dublin through my study abroad experience and I am so grateful for all of the memories made while here.","5.0","5.0","","3 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115374405946224658043/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx8ZKr4uP7AhXAGFkFHUr1AkgQvfQBegUIARCMAg","www.google.com","","Griffith College","179","4.0","S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland","ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08","https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08"

They do not have a proper faculty in house, they are using external coaches as well as external invigilators. Kids have upcoming deadline for dissertation to be submitted ...a few days from now and still they have not approved the dessertation topics and the questions and their simply bothering the kids by advising them either to pull out by just taking a diploma instead of a degree or to drop 6 months take a deferment and re appear after 6 month ....think wise before admitting your kids here for any of the courses it is better to send to another college or university then sending them to this Educational Institute.

"brian irons","I studied computer science here. I enjoyed my time there. Some of the lecturers were great and some we're not. My only bad experience I had there was they didn't really help you find internship during the third year. The issue is that college doesn't reach out to software companies to build relationships so these companies are willing to take on students for internships. It's up to you to find one. There was a class that was supposed to help us to find jobs but it was useless as the lecturer didn't care. Some of the lecturers are great once you get to know them and attend their classes they would gladly go out of their way to help you.","3.0","5.0","","3 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104143165370553085393/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx8ZKr4uP7AhXAGFkFHUr1AkgQvfQBegQIARBW","www.google.com","","Griffith College","179","4.0","S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland","ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08","https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08"

"Conor Nolan","Course studied: BA Business Blended study Currently in my second year of the three year degree Working full-time, I had completely written off any chance that I would study at third level. The month before I applied to Griffith I had watched my friends graduate from their respective studies and I really felt like I’d missed out. When I read about blended learning on the Griffith website, I ended up feeling like I'd stumbled across this amazing secret. Before applying, I was worried that working full-time would make it impossible to study without becoming a hermit. The truth is, you can actually keep a great balance if you make a plan early and stick to it. The blended learning approach involves weekly video lectures and webinars with monthly workshops delivered on Saturdays. The other students in my course are great, everyone works together to help one another, in particular around exam time. You're surrounded by other students in your exact position and the support network of students and lecturers help you stay on top of things. It can be challenging at times when work and college, unbeknownst to one another, get busier simultaneously. If, like me you plan on studying while working full-time, I would definitely recommend you have the conversation with work early and keep them in the loop. Once you can communicate with your employer what's going on with college, it can be much easier to harmonize work and study. Blended learning at Griffith has enabled me to study at third level and progress in my career before I've even graduated. It’s a great feeling when you can apply what you've studied in college, at work. Balancing work and college brings a structure to my life and helps keep me focused. I’m halfway through my degree now and I'm really proud of how far I've come. My biggest regret was that I didn’t start blended study sooner.","5.0","5.0","","3 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116644202622208860213/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARBE","www.google.com","","Griffith College","179","4.0","S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland","ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08","https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08"
"Yshika","Hands down! This might be a small college in comparison to others giant universities in Dublin but their services, academic courses and faculty is the best. It's more worthy than the fees you pay especially for the course I pursued that is Master's in Pharmaceutical Business and Technology.","5.0","5.0","","2 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115925619598886172539/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARBa","www.google.com","","Griffith College","179","4.0","S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland","ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08","https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08"
"Ned Panara","Griffith College is an amazing school. The campus is extremely pretty, the staff is great, and the customer service is beyond comparison. A great location off of South Circular Road, close to many local cafes, restaurants, and pubs. This is the perfect place to explore your options, as you can participate Undergraduate, Postgraduate, or Short courses to fulfill whatever goals you may desire. Being on campus, I can confirm that I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Griffith and can't wait to see what the future holds.","5.0","5.0","","3 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100490093554918470263/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARAC","www.google.com","","Griffith College","179","4.0","S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland","ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08","https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08"
