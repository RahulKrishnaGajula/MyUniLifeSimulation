"Loveth Chidimma Ani","University College Cork, a center for excellence. Creates a home for international students. Makes effort to assist the international students to have a swift transition and settle in the community. Always checking on them, not just on the academic section, but general well being. I will choose this school a million times and wouldn't think twice to recommend to someone. They have state of the art classrooms, highly educated and friendly tutors, automatic gym membership for students, provision of accomodation, transport service from Dublin to Cork upon resumption. Arranges international meetings. There are endless reasons for one to choose this school including the location in a friendly city. I love University College Cork ‚ù§Ô∏è. To think I loved this university barely a year post covid, you need to see the school in full session now. Their standard is untouchable. Great student union officers.
