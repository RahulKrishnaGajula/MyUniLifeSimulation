"Brian Coughlan","Only gave 1 star because 0 stars isn't an option but truthfully 0 stars would be rich for this so called university. AVOID AT ALL COSTS they'll simply take your money and tell you to sit in your bedroom, they don't care about their students, instead spending all their time with ceremonies and guest visitors. They talk about their world class facilities but don't get too excited because you probably won't be allowed anywhere near them, luckily though you can just watch a video on your laptop for which you'll be charged a nice fee. My advice is save your money and just watch some YouTube videos, they're free or honestly just go to UCC they'll actually let you attend college.","1.0","5.0","","a year ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114609462220850567177/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCysfL6OP7AhUqFlkFHYvSBTkQvfQBegUIARCyAQ","www.google.com","","Munster Technological University","190","4.5","Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland","ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE","https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE"

"Tyrannosaurus Rex","When my school orchestra went over to Ireland the past week (20 May 2014) all the way from the USA we went to visit/ play with the Cork School of Music's youth quire. They were absolutely amazing and I can see why this school has such a prestigious name. After getting a tour of the facility, I was just taken away on how amazing it was and how much money is put into funding their music program.

"Ahmed Kabir","Munster Technological University (MTU) is a well ranked university in Cork, Ireland. Faculty of Engineering is very popular. MSc. in Data science under dept. of Mathematics is one the cheaper one year course . Plenty of Indian students studying data science and getting good jobs, once graduated. Professors are highly profiled and offering graduate studentship or PhD positions to talented student. Also, significant number of scholarships for native and foreign students which cover both the tuition fees and living expenses. All prospective student please keep in mind that don't through garbage email or CV to professors. Organized your CV and email like a professional and I bet you will get a positive feed back. MTU is also friendly for foreign students. There is a football ground and Gymnasium for sports and exercise. The bus no. 205 is going to city center from MTU. Free toilets are located in each floor in each building but only accessible for students and staffs. However, strangers might sneak in and can use the toilet too. Enough students accommodations to accommodate large number of students but expensive! Student can also rent and share house outside which is relatively cheaper. The main problem is that there are no large groceries shops nearby, therefore, need to walk or take the bus. There is a Indian groceries shops called Spice town (16 Uam Var Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, T12 HWX3) but pretty bit far from MTU by walking.","5.0","5.0","","a year ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105812569133654134650/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARAY","www.google.com","","Munster Technological University","190","4.5","Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland","ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE","https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE"
"Graeme Hosford","The quality of teaching and staff is absolutely shocking. The lecturers don't seem to have a clue what they're doing half the time and seem to go out of their way to pile on unnecessary busy work with the apparent thought that their subject is the only one that matters and no regard is given to anything else which takes up our time. I'm 2 years into my course and I would advise anyone thinking of going here to just go to UCC instead it can't possibly be any less organised there. To give a few examples of the sort of thing to expect from CIT there's been plenty of times we've been a few weeks into a project or assignment and then get told the lecturer has changed their mind on what they want done forcing us to redo it either partially or totally. Overall I think the college is OK but there doesn't seem to be any review by someone in charge of what the staff are actually accomplishing which seems to be less and less which each new class.","1.0","5.0","","3 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101659637525363328439/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARBa","www.google.com","","Munster Technological University","190","4.5","Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland","ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE","https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE"

"Alexis Walkden","When actually working in a relative industry, you realise just how outdated and basic the Multimedia / Creative Digital Media course is. Now working in digital marketing, nothing I was taught in the course was truly relevant except for the business class and web development. Flash isn't relevant to ANY industry in this day and age. If you plan on asking for a reference afterwards from the department head, forget about it. You don't even get a response to give reasons why they can't or won't. Only two lecturers were memorable for being any good out of the entire four years. Some lecturers were out because they were going in and out of rehab. You pay three grand a year to be told, go watch instructional YouTube videos. That said, easy course for someone who wants a degree for the sake of it or pleasing their parents. Knock yourselves out, have the best four years of your life.","3.0","5.0","","2 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101954247448741417184/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegUIARCgAQ","www.google.com","","Munster Technological University","190","4.5","Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland","ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE","https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE"
