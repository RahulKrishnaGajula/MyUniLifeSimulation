42,Karumwa Family,"So we did an our final exam research methods 1 for April intake 2022 for our masters program. Exams results came out and we moved on to next semester. Only for the university to send us an email telling us we have repeat the exams done in research methods 1 because they noted some 'Academic Impropriety'.

44,Cleiton Nunes,"DBS was the worst institution I've studied my whole life, even considering that I did a previous degree in a ""third-world country"". Having professional experience in the field I've chosen to study at DBS and also having a previous degree on the same area I can tell that main topics of important modules are not given to the students in my class. There are lecturers with an amazing professional CV or even great career achievements, but at the same time I've seen people learning or understanding nothing from them, even different groups would tell they couldn't follow the classes. One of those terrible lecturers once refused to give explanations or clarify the topics ""explained"". The college has no transparency with the students and all information given ate mostly not accurate or incomplete. I was January intake and my class just found out we were not having holidays 1 month before the end of our classes, at the same time that we were taken by surprise by the college saying we would have to pay earlier than expected.

45,Sam Mathew,Not a bad college to be fairly honest but could do better with how they approach teaching. Lectures are seen in a boring light by the majority anyway so lecturers could bring a bit more enthusiasm and chip to the classroom and engage with the students more rather than just read off PowerPoint slides (we could do that at home if we wanted). Support provided by Admin staff is however stellar. Any requests and advice is provided promptly so kudos to that.

I mailed my lecturer there is no response from them, I mailed each and every staff and again no response, the management can't find any solution for me, nothing, zero, till now I am mailing them.

77,Danielle,"Still waiting on results ? I wouldn’t recommend dkit. The lecturers don’t care about anything other than their wages. Even if you reach out to some of them on email, you probably won’t get a response for weeks at a time. One of our lecturers have been amazing and I would love if they all followed the same process as her however that is not the case. When spending enormous amounts of money on an ‘education’ I’d expect appropriate conduct, teaching and resources yet this is not the case. On top of that if you miss a class even though they are all recorded, it seems some lecturers will hold a grudge, which is sad in fact. We all have busy lives just trying to get by so if the class of recorded why should being present at the time matter? Why don’t you find lecturers who actually have a passion for teaching? Instead you take ones on who already have multiple jobs resulting in them neglecting their students, teaching process and results.

95,brian irons,I studied computer science here. I enjoyed my time there. Some of the lecturers were great and some we're not. My only bad experience I had there was they didn't really help you find internship during the third year. The issue is that college doesn't reach out to software companies to build relationships so these companies are willing to take on students for internships. It's up to you to find one. There was a class that was supposed to help us to find jobs but it was useless as the lecturer didn't care. Some of the lecturers are great once you get to know them and attend their classes they would gladly go out of their way to help you.,3.0,5.0,,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104143165370553085393/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx8ZKr4uP7AhXAGFkFHUr1AkgQvfQBegQIARBW,www.google.com,,Griffith College,179,4.0,"S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland",ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08,"https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08

97,Conor Nolan,"Course studied: BA Business Blended study Currently in my second year of the three year degree Working full-time, I had completely written off any chance that I would study at third level. The month before I applied to Griffith I had watched my friends graduate from their respective studies and I really felt like I’d missed out. When I read about blended learning on the Griffith website, I ended up feeling like I'd stumbled across this amazing secret. Before applying, I was worried that working full-time would make it impossible to study without becoming a hermit. The truth is, you can actually keep a great balance if you make a plan early and stick to it. The blended learning approach involves weekly video lectures and webinars with monthly workshops delivered on Saturdays. The other students in my course are great, everyone works together to help one another, in particular around exam time. You're surrounded by other students in your exact position and the support network of students and lecturers help you stay on top of things. It can be challenging at times when work and college, unbeknownst to one another, get busier simultaneously. If, like me you plan on studying while working full-time, I would definitely recommend you have the conversation with work early and keep them in the loop. Once you can communicate with your employer what's going on with college, it can be much easier to harmonize work and study. Blended learning at Griffith has enabled me to study at third level and progress in my career before I've even graduated. It’s a great feeling when you can apply what you've studied in college, at work. Balancing work and college brings a structure to my life and helps keep me focused. I’m halfway through my degree now and I'm really proud of how far I've come. My biggest regret was that I didn’t start blended study sooner.",5.0,5.0,,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116644202622208860213/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiWxNCr4uP7AhUaF2IAHQ_jCegQvfQBegQIARBE,www.google.com,,Griffith College,179,4.0,"S Circular Rd, Saint Catherine's, Dublin 8, Ireland",ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08,"https://www.google.com/search?q=griffith+college&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Griffith+College&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i433i512j46i433i512j0i512j46i175i199i512j0i512l6.884j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670c1833b915c7:0x4f83acae16f5062e,1,,,",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJxxW5MxgMZ0gRLgb1Fq6sg08

There are student societies that are fun to join and one gets to meet other students from different programs.,5.0,5.0,,2 years ago,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIHLutwJjnDqiRMMVB0OX9upPaO9xp1hRQQrr3 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrVtDmhSaRGSlRkYp0SkuVXSg-pckxZfVG6z1x | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFZuuxG8p0uYHQNSCDY0k0P9yyEffR1hNZjWv- | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdGcZ6rgcQFnqPfABfYZXX_3OfbwnzP2uhnVuY | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1fRoOvKlNKz4S0NfORharAbrrFRkl4ym7yF0L | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr-griHCcHbxgGTpF0akmDr8ZLzufiZBfaKDpF | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmY83nkEYwjhHLbdqcqBkQvf8VSoexLp3NQDSJ | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwxTtLGhmSCsP_hB_lsPPVQ1pLoSqz5eeNx8K7 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqM4qpURWRfyMLkdEaUxMv_FqhwOj1Y5KZxi6p | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6FfNc3OGxr6EkjvZSelu780oBZbOrTbGhUtju | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxVlxsr_xIxCY2iVzGQzXWCv7DsDmPl1GmObff | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL8AxFCoNEsHpv1P5B8FNRPV834wX92BlY0Hn1 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjhmHOEloOg7FDUYYN84yakoQNhQxL6q02wZjj | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiFEjR6jCfMPTqpqJWpOgjJEezg1tWGKUh5mDu | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQfYcwyCDYW1M9gGszHJfmBrzLt2-usiLZO1iH | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCS2V7vKlg0eodpLE1fkUo1RoJDy87bJ7gp1hT | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgNLMOg8QhdCCZvwyDeAcyWBhBDBXwgRtHVs3m | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5PJ70cGPqTvBndqLGGE6yPcE74PSjKvjDtgUB | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5RLf7mH7REAElmCiKFZrSuEffy-dufaBYGgu4 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_QmgAqfRaZAxEJhm9sFn8RQgsfrOzSdPHyMcH | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgO5tNMVMVmB0O_7DgOaQg6LZLrOGqDH7fu6RR | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcO7zm1Q7vKyOh5zZmSDm7yW7JF3i_AOs7kePO | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuX5oRGaJvwd-fWfsC0jYobRPF5CCFhqojhy-v | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5aEWPsRXVTi2f6BK_07TwiVEUUPfPsKRp3D-f | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJFAW8Oni9Lp4OP8VAIQbiIWPSz8rIeK5XRaj7 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoN-mdg32kz_NSw8ZLXzENGwhsv6-qmFAKvoO3 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKleRmxsB2v7BAzvvwGYbXJw55nR8jwMeUHFtb | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8el8EGP3uyNI8kIc1U0s9bYTnjw8vHj6Duq-y | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQuzjvvR9UDOKzQ7aNr_nYpflC6Lug_AS1kiFn | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdLeTpk4q8os7QNXsy9d0tZIqJ_4iF446didzb | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaivTkWiL9cT3oSKb13f6TQvnrabmD3R3-nHtQ | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe05rTQoJN5TGSoXDdDx1F_QHvtL_agCnTOu5m | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYIGmx5butinPe8ow-SoNUKQgOuk1d2sQxiwu3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106573422194574743494/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCysfL6OP7AhUqFlkFHYvSBTkQvfQBegQIARBM,www.google.com,,Munster Technological University,190,4.5,"Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland",ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE,"https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE

112,Ahmed Kabir,"Munster Technological University (MTU) is a well ranked university in Cork, Ireland. Faculty of Engineering is very popular. MSc. in Data science under dept. of Mathematics is one the cheaper one year course . Plenty of Indian students studying data science and getting good jobs, once graduated. Professors are highly profiled and offering graduate studentship or PhD positions to talented student. Also, significant number of scholarships for native and foreign students which cover both the tuition fees and living expenses. All prospective student please keep in mind that don't through garbage email or CV to professors. Organized your CV and email like a professional and I bet you will get a positive feed back. MTU is also friendly for foreign students. There is a football ground and Gymnasium for sports and exercise. The bus no. 205 is going to city center from MTU. Free toilets are located in each floor in each building but only accessible for students and staffs. However, strangers might sneak in and can use the toilet too. Enough students accommodations to accommodate large number of students but expensive! Student can also rent and share house outside which is relatively cheaper. The main problem is that there are no large groceries shops nearby, therefore, need to walk or take the bus. There is a Indian groceries shops called Spice town (16 Uam Var Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, T12 HWX3) but pretty bit far from MTU by walking.",5.0,5.0,,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105812569133654134650/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARAY,www.google.com,,Munster Technological University,190,4.5,"Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland",ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE,"https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE
113,Graeme Hosford,The quality of teaching and staff is absolutely shocking. The lecturers don't seem to have a clue what they're doing half the time and seem to go out of their way to pile on unnecessary busy work with the apparent thought that their subject is the only one that matters and no regard is given to anything else which takes up our time. I'm 2 years into my course and I would advise anyone thinking of going here to just go to UCC instead it can't possibly be any less organised there. To give a few examples of the sort of thing to expect from CIT there's been plenty of times we've been a few weeks into a project or assignment and then get told the lecturer has changed their mind on what they want done forcing us to redo it either partially or totally. Overall I think the college is OK but there doesn't seem to be any review by someone in charge of what the staff are actually accomplishing which seems to be less and less which each new class.,1.0,5.0,,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101659637525363328439/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH3pbM6OP7AhUBKFkFHdK3CVQQvfQBegQIARBa,www.google.com,,Munster Technological University,190,4.5,"Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland",ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE,"https://www.google.com/search?q=munster+technological+university&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=M&aqs=chrome.1.69i60j69i59l2j69i60l4j69i65.1573j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x484491de5fdd3135:0xc15ee797da7bd2f6,1,,,",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJNTHdX96RREgR9tJ72pfnXsE

202,Mayank Srivastava,A great place to study and attain the necessary skills to succeed in professional life. You'll also make friends from several countries.

206,Marian English,"My wife and I have been to UCH Limerick on several occasions and have enjoyed many performances through the years. The concert hall is spacious and warm with excellent disability facilities. The staff are courteous and helpful. Tonight, we went to see Rebecca Storm in concert. We arrived at 7.40pm and 10 minutes later we were still trying to find a free parking space.The main car park was full. We were unable to access the other car parks as entry was blocked by a lowered barrier. This was annoying and disappointing. Our advice is to arrive earlier than usual to secure your parking. UCH is an excellent venue to attend concerts. The acoustics are superb.
