"Ernesto Baez","What an amazing place. The campus is absolutely beautiful very safe and transport directly to and from Dublin. Our dorms were right next the river/creek and we could hear the birds signing all the time. At nights the campus can be so enchanting with a slight drizzle that never seems to get you wet you, with a fog so dense you can barely see 2 meters in-front of you. The facilities are first class and my experience with the staff and fellow student body was nothing short lifelong memories.","5.0","5.0","","a year ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlypy45vjZ7j0gOpIJQJ-9E-hO_nS3edw_lGNj | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ9oVuVUCjNkPJJ8WadYev714tJ7Oq-6CPLLi2 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2i4Vv1U4pZk0Its8Dgi6-hByH7KW73wavOEoe | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPayuJwTgAPGtbGtJpA70teYgq_nCWhBF9VN951 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6m04yY1Qi3cV3EMgRC6rMS96-aF74ZfcF4shN | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRd3bj2sfNQhmLJ41KnUjoKZd9wFDCI3h-mVLi | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGxAeh3eDqmyIYOpB7esP4dQ4ecvOICIcf6SG3 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6A65lGbKGEAFCmvv4lDPyljvrJkrPSC6eWong | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOseqz3XCOrJzU2qDUuOLvKBeyE8rvcwC3zC4Xh | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhieE1XvpJseofdJeWClra4N-dvu2U8j_dYphS","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108227305539677121816/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS6pzN5uP7AhX7EGIAHQIQA-oQvfQBegQIARA6","www.google.com","","University of Limerick","433","4.7","Castletroy, County Limerick, Ireland","ChIJc1guIZheW0gRLfzDqvPrf8o","https://www.google.com/search?q=university+of+limerick&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=University+of+Limerick&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j46i20i175i199i263i512j0i512j46i512j46i175i199i512j0i512j69i60j69i61.822j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x485b5e98212e5873:0xca7febf3aac3fc2d,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJc1guIZheW0gRLfzDqvPrf8o"

The campus is massive and it might take a while before you can fully explore every corner of the University. The University is also the modern amenities and facilities.

"Marian English","My wife and I have been to UCH Limerick on several occasions and have enjoyed many performances through the years. The concert hall is spacious and warm with excellent disability facilities. The staff are courteous and helpful. Tonight, we went to see Rebecca Storm in concert. We arrived at 7.40pm and 10 minutes later we were still trying to find a free parking space.The main car park was full. We were unable to access the other car parks as entry was blocked by a lowered barrier. This was annoying and disappointing. Our advice is to arrive earlier than usual to secure your parking. UCH is an excellent venue to attend concerts. The acoustics are superb. We will be back.","4.0","5.0","","a month ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118204767429140467076/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiS6pzN5uP7AhX7EGIAHQIQA-oQvfQBegUIARCwAQ","www.google.com","","University of Limerick","433","4.7","Castletroy, County Limerick, Ireland","ChIJc1guIZheW0gRLfzDqvPrf8o","https://www.google.com/search?q=university+of+limerick&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=University+of+Limerick&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j46i20i175i199i263i512j0i512j46i512j46i175i199i512j0i512j69i60j69i61.822j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x485b5e98212e5873:0xca7febf3aac3fc2d,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJc1guIZheW0gRLfzDqvPrf8o"
