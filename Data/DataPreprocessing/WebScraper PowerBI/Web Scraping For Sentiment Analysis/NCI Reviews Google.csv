"Gerard McQuillan","Excellent college! I just finished my first year on the MSc in Marketing part-time and the experience to date has been exceptional. The lecturers are great, they really get you to critical think about the different topics and case studies which really adds to the learning process. I’m really looking forward to returning in September and getting stuck in to Year 2.","5.0","5.0","","6 years ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112664442928686032089/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDzOeM4eP7AhVxFVkFHbs2C78QvfQBegUIARD1AQ","www.google.com","","National College of Ireland","171","4.1","Mayor Street Lower, International Financial Services Centre, Dublin 1, Ireland","ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0","https://www.google.com/search?q=national+college+of+ireland&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Na&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j35i39j46i131i175i199i433i512j69i60l3.918j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e8cd86e97e7:0x6d51b774ee7fa935,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0"
"Numan Ahmed","Best College in Ireland for Higher Education. I am a student of BA Hons in Business Management Final year at National College of Ireland. I am targeting to complete my Hons Degree by end of July 2021. I had the best expirience of learning in National College of Ireland, the College is very supportive in every aspects. I got great help so many times from library help center (Mr Keith and teams who helped every time for my projects) all the lecturers are very friendly and supportive. My Programme Director Mr. Dave Cormack (who also taught a module Leadership and Influencing) is an amazing and helpful person and contactable at any time for any help. Programme Coordinator Miss Lillian and Miss Danielle are also very helpful and supportive. Finally looking forward to do my Masters in September from National College of Ireland.","5.0","5.0","","a year ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107670362110363580870/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDzOeM4eP7AhVxFVkFHbs2C78QvfQBegUIARCLAg","www.google.com","","National College of Ireland","171","4.1","Mayor Street Lower, International Financial Services Centre, Dublin 1, Ireland","ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0","https://www.google.com/search?q=national+college+of+ireland&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Na&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j35i39j46i131i175i199i433i512j69i60l3.918j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e8cd86e97e7:0x6d51b774ee7fa935,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0"

"Connal Donohoe","My experience here was very poor, I completed 2 years of the computing level 8 course and not only were my lecturers in 2nd year absolutely horrendous, the support available is next to none, there is no easy access to guidance counsellors, any email you send through email it was rarely answered, and when I asked multiple times about switching course they never gave me guidance on it, so I just made a new application and was told I'd be updated within a week, 5 approx weeks pass and I decide to email them, they blamed me because they left me a voice mail, that I never seen because it literally said, and I quote ""All official communication regarding your application will be by email"". The course I could have been in is now full and I'm extremely disappointed. Not only that, they then told me I would have had to complete a transfer form since I was a current student, would have been great if there was ANYWHERE I could have learned that but there wasn't, nothing on the website and no replies when I asked them directly. There's plenty more I could ramble on about but I definitely wish I would have chose somewhere else after my leaving cert 2 years ago","1.0","5.0","","a year ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115261440580377380446/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDzOeM4eP7AhVxFVkFHbs2C78QvfQBegUIARCzAQ","www.google.com","","National College of Ireland","171","4.1","Mayor Street Lower, International Financial Services Centre, Dublin 1, Ireland","ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0","https://www.google.com/search?q=national+college+of+ireland&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Na&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j35i39j46i131i175i199i433i512j69i60l3.918j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e8cd86e97e7:0x6d51b774ee7fa935,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0"

"The Travelling Camera","Never been inside the college but I highly recommend it for parking. Spaces can be tight but the cost more than compensates at €2.50 per hour or €9 for the day with €7.50 for an evening after 5.30pm or €2.50 per hour. The car park, which is underneath the College, closes at 11pm.","5.0","5.0","","11 months ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw2UrvGI0sYfdM3AEa_A5nXNGWzibAN7-1sGBe","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105904992361680733326/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDzOeM4eP7AhVxFVkFHbs2C78QvfQBegQIARBA","www.google.com","","National College of Ireland","171","4.1","Mayor Street Lower, International Financial Services Centre, Dublin 1, Ireland","ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0","https://www.google.com/search?q=national+college+of+ireland&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN962IN962&oq=Na&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j35i39j46i131i175i199i433i512j69i60l3.918j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x48670e8cd86e97e7:0x6d51b774ee7fa935,1,,,","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ55du2IwOZ0gRNal_7nS3UW0"
"Veronica Stone","Perfect place for a youth conference. The only issue I had which dropped from a 5 star to a 4 star is the car park disabled parking space being the opposite side from the lift.
