## Not Good

- Not evereyone in the team is committing code frequently & PR are large insted of minor code updates.
- Not everyone in the team is contributing to the project and this is extremely frustrating. There is no need to point fingers as according to our professors it is painfully visible based on github contributions and weekly videos. This is still happening.
- No proper communication between all team members and this is causing delays for development.


## Really not good

- Almost no initiative to be involved in the development process by few members of the group
- Expert reviews have not been collected.
- Final phase of user evaluations is not completed yet
- Fights and quarrels among team members in terms of accountability.

## To be done
