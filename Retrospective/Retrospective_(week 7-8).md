# Retrospective 03/11/2022 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## Good

### Sentiment Analysis
- We have collected a good amount of Informative data for sentiment Anaysis
- Detailed work has been done on the sentiment analysis code. The data has been cleaned, labelled and then used for prediction.
- 4 Machine learning algorithms have been applied. Appropriate evaluations have been performed and added to the code
- The Data generated has been used with Power BI dashboards to create a visualization of all the reviews.
- The dashboard also contains a table will the data collected from the processed file.

### Interest Profiler
- Interest profiler is up and running. We are getting the desired output.
- 6 Different algorithms were used in the interest profiler to compare and find the best model with the highest accuracy(dt,rf) along with 3 different train test splits
- The model was trained and exported as a weight.pkl file to be used in the prediction based UI which asks for 20 user inputs   and    predict job accordingly.
- The model output is currently being displayed on streamlit. 
- User Feedback is done for the interest profiler. We have feedback on what we can improve.

### UI/UX
- The UI has considerable improvement. We have the front end ready to go for almost all the pages.
- The Pages are completely responsive and in proper sequence.
- The pages are accepting the user inputs and pushing it to the backend.

### Game Simulation/Datasets
- Game simulation is well underway.
- We have collected data for the universities. Data was collected and processed from different websites.
- Sufficient data for interest profiler and recommendor system


## Not Good

- Could not implement Deep Learning techniques for the sentiment analysis
- Power BI Dashboard needs a lot more refinement and needs to be more detailed.
- The model output for the interest profiler is currently of Streamlit server, and we are facing issues with API calls
- Based on user feedback, interest profiler could have more questions and pleasant color scheme.
- Facing issues with integrating UI with the back end.
- Lot more work needed on the Game simulation.

## Really not good

- Since the API calls are failing on Streamlit, we have to move to Flask. Implementation is taking a lot of time.
- We need to dedicate more time than ever now that we are in the final phase of the project.
- Cant get the output of the interest profiler on our application without successful API calls.

## To be done

- Work on the Integration of the UI with the back end as all the systems are coming in place.
- Add even more complexity to the Recommeder System & interest profiler
- Keep adding data to our datasets to make our applications more informative.
- User feedback on sentiment analysis.
- User evaluation report.
- As per Damian, we need to do statistical analysis on all our dataset
- Add an assessment exam for students to get an idea of the exams conducted in university
- Acceptance Prediction system
