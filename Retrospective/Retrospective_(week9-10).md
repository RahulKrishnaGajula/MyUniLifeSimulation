# Retrospective 03/11/2022 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## Good
 
- We have collected a good amount of questions for the Interest Profiler as Paul suggested to make it broader to include other majors too.
- Our website is almost completed with 80% of the figma pages being deployed on the heroku application.
- The recommender system is coming along well, it is currently recommending one output.
- The recommender system has been integrated with flask so we can continue with our UI intergration.
- Tasks were divided evenly among all the team members.
- Interest Profiler now has multiple reference points to increase complexity (datasets and detailed output)
- The Sentiment Analysis code is now complete and we can use it to predict sentiments for any statements.
- 2D game has been scrapped based on feedback from Damian
- Sample examination module is in progress.
- Integration is almost complete
- We have colleced course data for each of the courses in our dataset to be displayed on our website in JSON format
- Added more Machine Learning models to all the backend notebooks to improve and compare model accuracy
- K-Fold Cross validation is complete for all the machine learning models.

## Not Good

- We are not comiting code frequently & PR are large insted of minor code updates.
- Still, there is a lack of dedicated collaboration. (we saw a huge improvement this week in collaboration)
- UI integration is almost done.
- Minimal Progress on the sentiment analysis dashboard.
- We need to add more fields to the recommender system.
- Data collection is taking too much time as its being done manually for all the courses. For this week we only have Dublin, Athlone, Limerick ready

## Really not good

- We need to be more proactive in the development process.
- We need to dedicate more time than ever now that we are in the final phase of the project.
- Pending with some webpages of the system.
- Backlog on features for Recommender system which needs to be completed before final submission.

## To be done

- Integration of all the components with the frontend
- Add even more complexity to the Recommeder System & interest profiler
- Final User evaluation with the integrated system (1 Website instead of multiple individual components).
- Deploy the web application on AWS.
- Now that our Interest Profiler, Recommendation System, and Sentiment Analysis is in good progress, we just need to keep adding more complexity and fields because the recommender system looks quite empty.
- Adding lambda based functions in AWS to scrape data automatically for Interest Profiler which will be auto-updated every week.
- Complete the course data collection
- Add in more questions to the interest profiler.
- Distribute sections of the final report between team members
