# Retrospective 03/11/2022 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## Good
 
- We have a good amount of user feedback for our Interest Profiler and Sentiment Analysis which we will be using for improving the system (user feedback).
- Questionnaires were sent to our user groups for the evaluation of Interest Profiler and Sentiment Analysis Dashboard.
- The recommender system is coming along well, it is currently recommending one output.
- The recommender system has been integrated with flask so we can continue with our UI intergration.
- Tasks were divided evenly among all the team members.
- User Evaluation report has been completed and we have amended it according to Damian's Feedback.
- We found 5+ datasets which we will use in the Interest Profiler & sentiment analysis (uploaded on git)
- Interest Profiler now has multiple reference points to increase complexity (datasets and detailed output)
- The Sentiment Analysis code is now complete and we can use it to predict sentiments for any statements.
- 2D game development is in progress. 
- Sample examination module is in progress.

## Not Good

- Still, the system flow is not completely coherent with the lectures.
- We are not comiting code frequently & PR are large insted of minor code updates.
- Still, there is a lack of dedicated collaboration. (we saw a huge improvement this week in collaboration)
- UI integration is not done yet.
- Minimal Progress on the sentiment analysis dashboard.
- We need to add more fields to the recommender system.

## Really not good

- We need to be more proactive in the development process.
- We need to dedicate more time than ever now that we are in the final phase of the project.
- Pending with some webpages of the system.
- Backlog on features for Recommender system which needs to be completed before final submission.

## To be done

- Integration of all the components with the frontend
- Add even more complexity to the Recommeder System & interest profiler
- Complete the 2D Game by week 9 regardless.
- Final User evaluation with the integrated system (1 Website instead of multiple individual components).
- Deploy the web application on AWS.
- Now that our Interest Profiler, Recommendation System, and Sentiment Analysis is in good progress, we just need to keep adding more complexity and fields because the recommender system looks quite empty.
- Adding lambda based functions in AWS to scrape data automatically for Interest Profiler which will be auto-updated every week.
