# Retrospective 03/11/2022 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## Good
 
- We have split the tasks for the final report among the team members
- We have all our individual components working properly
- Integration is almost complete for the recommender system.
- Interest Profiler has been integrated with the website, we are getting the proper career output as expected
- Model Evaluations for ML Models are done (ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Collected one more huge dataset for a backup Interest Profiler 
- JSON data for college courses have been collected for almost all the cities (only mayo is pending)

## Not Good

- We are not committing code frequently & PR are large insted of minor code updates.
- Not everyone in the team is contributing to the project and this is extremely frustrating. There is no need to point fingers as according to our professors it is painfully visible based on github contributions and weekly videos.
- Still havent given the URL of the website to the lecturers


## Really not good

- Almost no initiative to be involved in the development process by few members of the group
- Expert reviews have not been collected.
- Final phase of user evaluations is not completed yet
- We have a mountain of work to do in the last week of the project.
- Fights and quarrels among team members in terms of accountability.

## To be done

- Submit the URL to lecturers
- Perform final User Evaluations and Expert Reviews
- Make changes to system based on expert reviews
- Integration of the recommender system
- Backup Interest Profiler (In case of bad feedback for the first one)
