# Retrospective 03/11/2022 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## Good

- We found 10+ datasets which we will use in Recommender System, Interest Profiler & sentiment analysis (uploaded on git)
- We have a good amount of user feedback for our interim system which we will be using for improving the system (user feedback)
- Tasks were divided evenly among all the team members.
- Code for the recommender system is coming along well with the datasets we are using.
- Interest Profiler now has multiple reference points to increase complexity (datasets and detailed output)
- Website is now hosted on AWS & Heroku app.
- UI is coming along nicely and will have AI elements in it as suggested by Damian to make it more interactive.
- We started working on the user evaluation report.
- 2D game development is in progress. 

## Not Good

- Still, the system flow is not completely coherent with the lectures.
- We are not comiting code frequently & PR are large insted of minor code updates.
- Still, there is a lack of dedicated collaboration. (we saw a huge improvement this week in collaboration)

## Really not good

- We need to be more proactive in the development process.
- We need to dedicate more time than ever now that we are in the final phase of the project.

## To be done

- Integration of all the components with the frontend
- Add even more complexity to the Recommeder System & interest profiler
- Complete the 2D Game by week 9 regardless.
