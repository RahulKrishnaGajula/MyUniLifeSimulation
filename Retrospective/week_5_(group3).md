# Retrospective for Week 5 (Group 3- Fork The Data)

## To-Do - On going development
- Need to integrate Interest profiler with scrapped dataset and have a sample output ready before presentation
- Make Progress in Recommeder system 
	- Data correction is to be done for column "CAO points" in m_dataset. (more accurate data scrapping is required if needed)
	- For Collaborative filtering-based systems with LSTM, we need to have it display more than 5 fields in the prefernce output. (CNN is not the most accurate)
	- Content-based Recommender Systems will be main point of focus for week 5,6,7 as we will be improving on the accuray rate of the output.
- UI is not scalable as of now, We need to make it dynamically scalable on all the devices by end of next week.
- Existing Sentiment analysis notebook is being extended to work with the scraped reviews (r_dataset) of TUD campuses.

## Important Points to be taken into account
- Delete old source code of the website which is not in use from github
- Change the scrum master for week 6 (rahul -> rakshith)
- Start updating the readme.md file for features and working of the application
- Meet the deadline for PR's (everyone)
- Continue updating the jira board & generate the report out of it on friday.
